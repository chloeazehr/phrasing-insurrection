SIR,
IN the last Session of our Assembly, the declining Condition of this Island was taken into Consideration, with Regard to the low Value of its Produce, which daily declining, greatly discourages the present Settlers, and those that have Estates, and hath for some Years past intirely put a Stop to the further Improvement or Settlement of this large, fertile, & valuable Island; so that for seven Years last past, instead of increasing in the Number of our Inhabitants, we have decreased at least one Third, which renders the great Charges we are at for the necessary Support of the Government the more difficult, and almost insupportable to the few remaining Inhabitants. To speak the Truth of our Condition, if some speedy Remedy is not found out, and some new Encouragement given, I expect to see in a few Years this Island left only in the Hands of a few Proprietors of Sugar-Works, who do not amount to above 300, and those we compute one with another employ each 5 white Men, which is but 1500; all our other Inhabitants, and those that have other small Settlements, are going off daily. The Proprietors of Sugar-Works, (many of whom are in Great Britain ) must stand by and keep their Interest in it till the last, as their Estates consist of great Buildings, Plantations, Utensils, large Tracts of Land well cultivated, great Quantities of Cattle, which if they remove their Slaves from, to go to other Countries, will be of no Value but a dead Loss, and so two Thirds of their Estates sunk; this Reason will oblige the Sugar Planters to stand it the longest; and God knows that is a short Space enough, considering the dismal Prospect they have of the declining Condition of their Estates, the Increase of our Rebel Negroes, and the Loss of our Trade. We find all the European Markets, except Great Britain supply'd by the French and Dutch Sugar Colonies, & even a great part of the British Empire likewise, as Ireland , which hath for several Years been supply'd with French Sugar; and the British northern Colonies, which now swarm with People (and are a daily Drain to the Sugar Colonies) supply themselves with Sugar and Molasses from the French and Dutch ; so that all the Consumption of the British Colonies (by the Restriction laid on their Trade) is reduced to Great Britain only; and consequently what Sugars are made more than is required for that Purpose, can be of little other Use than to lower the Price and Value of even that.

These unhappy Circumstances have struck such a Damp on the Inhabitants of this Island, that nothing is heard but Preparations for the Northern Colonies; and Carolina begins to encourage great Numbers to adventure there, forasmuch as by the great, Goodness of his Majesty, and the Wisdom of the Parliament, the Enumeration of Rice is taken off, and they have Liberty to send it to foreign Markets directly, which will bring such a flow of Riches to that Colony as will help, I fear, to be very much the Downfal of the British West India Sugar Colonies, except some such Encouragement be given to them: And it is to be hoped his Majesty's great Goodness will indulge him to recommend the Consideration [ ] to the Wisdom of his Parliament, and that they will have such a Regard to the Welfare of Britain, as to support its principal Members, the Sugar Colonies, which employ such vast Numbers of their Fellow-Subjects in their Mother Country, and are a great support to the Figure they now make in Trade, by the Employment of Ships and Men, this Island alone employing yearly at least 300 sail of Vessels and 5000 Mariners; and considering the advantagious Situation of it in Time of Peace for Trade to New Spain , and in case of a War, all our West India Colonies must be lost without this Island, they having no Harbour or Ports that his Majesty could keep a Squadron in, to command these Seas and protect them; and in case of bad Weather, which always happens amongst them once a Year, these Vessels that would be distressed, must put into an Enemy's Port or perish in the Sea, as we have no other British Settlements to Leeward off St. Christopher's but this Island. These Particulars, and many others too tedious to enumerate, being duly considered, I am sure there is a Necessity of doing something immediately to encourage the present Inhabitants to remain in the Country, and others to come; or I fear, in case of War, it will be so weak as to fall an easy Prey to our Potent Neighbours the French at Hispaniola, who by the great Encouragement from their Mother Country, are within a few Years grown so numerous in their Settlements and Inhabitants, as gives a dismal Prospect to us of this Island.

One Thing I am surprized never was considered among the Means thought of for preventing the Use as well as running French Brandy, which is the lessening the Excise on Rum, the Produce of our own Sugar Colonies, which, were it used instead of French Brandy, would save the Nation as much ready Cash as goes out of it for the Purchase thereof. Rum is the principal Commodity of this Island next to Sugar, and on which the Planters very much depended; it generally sells here from 18d. to 2s. per Gallon, so that 100 Punches of 110 Gallons each here, is about 1000l. this Island Currency, or 200l. Sterling Value; that Quantity, on exportation to Great Britain , is to pay a Duty and Excise to the Crown of about [ ]l. Sterling, without any Drawback on Exportation, besides 6d. per Gallon Freight, [ ] the Loss of Casks, Leakage, &c. so that the Planter at last has a mere Trifle for a Commodity, and what is worse, we have [ ] for Rum at the Northern Colonies, [ ] buy French Molasses so cheap (which without such a Vent would be a Loss to the French ) that they furnish themselves, and export large Quantities to other Countries; so that our Rum that used to contribute greatly to support the contingent Charges of Sugar-Works, by the heavy Duty, Excise, and Loss of the Northern Plantations Trade, will become of little other Value than to be given to Servants & Negroes; whereas, was half the Excise to be taken off, it would greatly increase the Revenue in Great Britain , and be a more effectual Method of preventing the Use of French Brandy than any yet practiced, and would be no Prejudice to English Spirits, not no Ways lessen the Quantity usually made. And sure I am, it highly becomes the Wisdom of the Nation to encourage the Colonies Abroad, each of whose Inhabitants, one with another, gives Bread to three (at least) of their Fellow Subjects in their Mother Country, I may say those of this Island do so treble that Number. Now, could we but obtain the Liberty of exporting our Sugars to Foreign Markets, on paying the Duty it leaves in Great Britain upon Exportation, with other Encouragements, this Island might be rendered the greatest in America , and would become much more Advantagious to Great Britain , in taking off more of its Manufactures, and employing a greater Number of Shipping and Sailors, in Proportion to the Increase of its Produce. For I assure you, that four Fifths of the valuable and improveable Land in this Island is not settled or cultivated, and lies waste as a Receptacle only for our rebellious Runaway Negroes. What I have said is sufficient to shew the infinite Value of this Island, its present miserable Circumstances, and the Necessity of some immediate Relief and Encouragement, to prevent the impending Ruin of the Inhabitants, and the utter Loss of this inestimable Jewel in the British Diadem.",blackUnrest

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Thomas Whitemarsh,1733_04_07,"April  7, 1733",1733,"The SUBJECT on Paper
Currency Concluded.
THAT the Prices of our
Produce is influenced in
the following Manner, I
think is very plain.
When our Crop is so
large, as to make a
Plenty at the Markets of
Consumption, and
furnish them with more
than they want
(supposing the Factors
here as Orders at large,
and the Freights at
common price) then the
Prices will necessarily
run low on Export; &
farther, a Scarcity of
Ships and Freight high,
also beats down the
Price still more.
Again, when our Crop falls
short, so as not fully to supply
the Markets aboard, we then
judging the Price will advance
at places of Consumption, are
thereby encouraged to give the
more here (And so much the
more as Freights are under the
common Rate).
But what I've observed
constantly to affect most the
price of our Produce, is
chartered Ships, or Orders to
several Factors at the same
time, for a certain Commodity,
without limiting a price,
occasions bidding on each
other, and frequently runs it
above its true Value.
If any one think this is not a
rational Account, but that the
Paper Currency does the
Mischief, I desire they would
give some better Reasons; and
shew how it has raised Pitch
from 35 to 50s. in four Weeks,
and falling it again to 40s. in
ten Days: How it was, that Rice
the beginning of Crop, at 45s.
fell to 40s. advanced again to
47s. in six Weeks. When Silver
did not alter Is. per Ounce, or
Exchange vary 5 per Cent. Or
why did not the additional
Currency of 50,000I.
Merchants Notes, afford some
Proof of this Objection: That
Year it was remarkably the
Contrary, for Sterling Bills
were never plentier; (&
Produce was low) but am apt to
think, had the Case been
otherwise, all that were against
that private (beneficial) Bank,
would have asserted it as the
Cause.
But says another, let the
Planters have Money on their
Lands to pay their Debts, they'll
keep Rice, &c. as home, 'till the
Merchant is forced to give the
Price they please to demand.
Will they so? (well, when the
Sky falls they'll catch Larks)
Where is the Man of two
Grains of Sense, being in Debt,
that will keep his Goods at
home, at the Expence of 10 per
Cent. And at so much
uncertainty, that he can't be
sure, but in the End, he may
loose 20 per Cent. On the Price
of his Goods. Again, it must be
a general Contrivance, and all
agree in it, or it won't the
Objector allow, it is as easy,
and full as likely, that the
Merchants in Charlestown,
would also combine to
Counter-plot them, by engaging
not to give them more than
certain price for Produce; and it
may be, carry it father, that they
would not sell Goods out of
their Stores, but a t a higher
Advance: Persons living
compact, as in Charlestown,
may sooner unite to the
Prejudice of the Planter, than
that they could all join from
North to South, through the
whole Country, in such a
Contrivance.
Further it is to be considered,
that the greatest part of the Rice
is now made be Gentlemen of
Estates, clear of Debt, and
therefore the same might be
practiced every year past, as
well as future; but don't we see
on the Contrary, these
Gentlemen the most forward in
cleaning out, & bringing to
market: It there may be any
who at otherwise, who seems
the most prudent and greatest
Gainer? The Former no doubt:
On the Whole, I think this
objection has so little, or rather
no Reason in it, that had I not
heard it from a Person of
reputed Sense, I could not have
suggested it.
Now, As to how much
Currency is necessary for this
Province, some there are, who
pretend to determine how much
is proper and convenient for
carrying on Trade; (indeed
more than enough in Paper
would be a Nusance) but I
never yet see any regular
Scheme, or the Reason on
which it's founded, by those
very correct Gentlemen, who
say the Sum extant (I mean
before the Orders) was Enough,
And that's Enough. I believe
the Usuerer says in his Heart,
it's ever too much, the less
there is the higher the Interest;
I'm not very careful to obtain
the Smiles, nor do I any more
regard the Frowns, of these
Persons.
Humanity ought to prevail, and
if we are commanded to Love
our Neighbours as our selves,
what is there less implied, than
serving our Neighbour in any
Degree, wherein we receive
equal Advantages; therefore the
Interest should be ascertained
at a reasonable Rate, to afford
(if possible) Advantages on
both Sides.
Now the Method I would
propose for ascertaining the
Sum needful for carrying on
the Trade of this Province: Let
a LOAN-OFFICE be opened
on the Terms aforesaid, and the
Interest kept at 10 per cent. I
dare venture to say, no more
will be borrowed than what's
absolutely wanted, and
necessary for conveniency of
Trade; and to that I would
confine the Sum, for at least
some Years, tho' it should not
exceed 30,000I. Principle, nor
do I think it would come to
50,000I. Proclamation Money.
It would not appear unjust to
offer some thing for
ascertaining the Rate of
Interest, I think it admits of
only one general Rule, that it
should (and does in all well
regulated places) bear
(constant) proportion to the
Profits arising on Trade, for it's
that which ascertains also the
Value of I and every where; this
is plain, by observing those
places where Trade is carried
on with least Profit, there
Interest is lowest; and where
there is no Commerce, there is
no such thing as Interest
Money. But, as in this Country,
we have so little trade of our
own, that we can't judge of it;
the Fountain and Center of our
Commerce being in Great
Britain: However, we have
Lands, and must estimate the
annual Profit that way; here,
I'm very sorry, the Scene opens
with a very melancholy
Prospect (to those already in
Debt), our Staple Commodities
falling in price from year to
Year, threatens Proverty and
Distress to those who have
nothing else to depend on; and
of late yeards, the Experience
of many Planters confirms, I
beleive, this Observation; that
with all their Industry and Cre,
they have not been able to
make 10 per cent. Profit on
Land and Slaves; I would
advise such to be wife in time,
and judge whether it would not
be much better to sell off and
balance with the Creditor, that
what remains may be clear,
than suffer a flow (but certain)
Moth of Interest, insensibly to
catout the whole,
It seems, most of our
Neighbours to the northward
don't exceed 6 per cent. per
Ann. The Sugar Islands were at
10, 'till of late; Barbadoes (if I
am right informed) have
reduced to 8. Perhaps, it might
have been better, if they had
done it sooner, and prevented
many of their Inhabitants going
off.
Putting every thing together, I
would humbly submit it,
whether the Circumstances of
this Province can well afford
continuing the Interest at 10
per cent. perhaps it may be
necessary to do it, until such
time as the publick Debt,
105,000 old Bills be paid off
which would be erected,
according to my Scheme, in six
Years or less; at which time, if
not before, I doubt not, all will
agree to reduce Interest, unless,
in the mean time, we should be
so fortunate, as to find some
new Staple or Manufacture, to
give new Life to the Planter
and others in Trade.
To Recapitulate the Substance
of what has been offered on
this Subject.
1.
A standing Paper Currency is
proposed, to continue until the
Nature or Circumstance of our
Trade will furnish us with that
which is better, Silver or Gold.
2.
That it be put on such a
Foundation, as shall be just and
equal to all concerned, which it
is conceived it will be, if the
Bill be kept to its original
Value.
3.
That it will be effected by
issuing it on Loan, provided the
Interest be paid in Silver or
Gold.
4.
After paying the Debt now
owing by the Publick the
Interest be applied towards the
Support of Governement.
If this Scheme, or something
like it, may be thought of Use,
something further may be
offered towards it",nonslave

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Lewis Timothy,1734_05_11,"May 11, 1734",1734,"Extract of a Letter from Antigua, dated Jan. 11, 1733-4.
There is a Blast upon the canes, which never was known in this Island before, which destroys them wholly wherever it come and many hundreds of Acres are wholly lost. It's very sickly in this Island; they die with a fever in two Days time, and many of an unusual  Throat in three Hours. But it seems, at Home they are resolved to defend the West-Indies, for 4 hours since a Letter from London informs, that nine Men of War a Regiment of Soldiers, and 150 Cannon are preparing for the West-Indies. Sixteen Days before my Arrival at Antigua, the Negroes on the Island of St. John's arose, and cut off the Whites, kill'd as Men, and a Remnant fled into the Wilderness. The station'd Ship of 60 sailed from Antigua-five Days after this fact, for these Relief, but to Day we had of the Negroes at Kit's, that the Week before last they attempted the same in that Island, by setting Six Houses on Fire, but were prevented of that Design, by a Negro that had a Regard for his Master, disclosing the Plot.",blackUnrest
The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Lewis Timothy,1734_06_29,"June 29, 1734",1734,"CHARLESTOWN, June
29. On Wednesday the
26 Inst.
was brought in here the Mary
Scooner from the Havanna,
under the command of Capt.
William Vaughan; and on
Thursday all the Persons on
board were ordered to appear
before his Majesty's Attorney
General to be examin'd upon
Oath: Their Examination lasted
from eleven in the Morning till
past 5 in the afternoon, and
imagining it may not be
disagreeable to the curious
(having been present when
their Depositions were taken) I
shall endeavour to oblige my
Readers with the justest
Representation of the Affair as
far as my Memory will permit.
The Scooner was the Property
of Don Francisco de Heymes,
who went on board her with his
Lady Donna Petrona de Castro
lately married, a young Lady of
21 Years of age, intending to go
to Port Guarico, al. Cape
Fransois, to visit their
Relations there, the other
persons on board were Dieagno
Captain, Juan Salvadore Mate,
one Frenchman from
Bourdeaux, and anthor old
Frenchman Jean Troistours,
going to Marseilles to his
Family, being a Wife and 5
Children; a Carpenter Joseph [
], a Cook, 4 Men of the Canary
Island, one Malteeze, a
Frenchman Peter Blanchard,
Sailors, and Negro Boy
attendant on the Lady.
They set sail from the Havanna
the latter end of May; 4 days
after the 4 Canary Men having
secretly entered in a
Conspiracy, arose in the night,
and kill'd the Captain, Mate,
and the Bourdeaux Passenger.
The Owner haring the Noise,
and going upon Deck, was met
by the 4 Canary Men at the
Cabin Door, and stabbed
immediately. Then one of them
Sword in hand commaded
Peter Blanchard the French
Sailor to go to the Helm,
enquiring in the interim if he
knew where the Money was;
who answering no, they went
down and searched the Cabin,
but to no purpose: They then
ordered the said Peter to search
the Lady's Bed, which he was
oblig'd to execute, but
discover'd none. They then
caused the Carpenter to unceal
the Cabin, where they found a
Quantity of Gold and 8 or 9
Bags with Silver, which they
were willing to divide among
the Ships-Company, but all
refused to participate of it, the
Carpenter only excepted.
'Twill not be very difficult for
any person to imagine the
terrible condition the young
Lady was in, seeing her
Husband murder'd, and herself
surrounded with, and entirely at
the mercy of such execrable
Villains, who robb'd her of her
Ear-rings, a Diamond Cross,
and several Rings.
The said 4 persons being
murder'd, the Pirats call'd all
the rest of the Ships Company
upon Deck, ordering everyone
to throw their Knifes, Guns and
other Weapons over board,
which they were obliged to do,
being seized with fear. They
now perceived they had no one
capable of stearing the Vessel,
so were necessitated to drive 5
or 6 Days, when they spyed
Land: But before they arrived
at it, the Conspirators
disagreeing among themselves,
the cause of which no one can
assign, two of them kill'd their
other two Accomplices.
They made on towards Land,
taking it to be Porto Rico,
proposing to kill all the rest,
and to sink the Vessel; and to
effect their purpose, they
anchored between two Rocks;
then hoisting out the Canoe,
they loaded her with
provisions, and put them on
shore; returning back they
fetched the Lady and the others
ashore, where they made Tents.
The two Pirates and Carpenter
row'd along shore, to see if they
could discover any Inhabitaints,
but perceived none. They
continued here 3 Days, and
finding it to be Cat Island, they
reconvey'd the People and
provisions on board, and
weighing Anchor put out again.
Two Days after they came to
Harbour-Island, where Capt.
Wm. Vaughan seeing the
Vessel, hailed them: One of the
Pirates, the Carpenter and
Peter, (who speaking French,
English, Spanish, and Dutch,
was kept alive to serve them for
Interpreter,) went on shore,
they enquired of the Captain, if
he had any person to conduct
their Vessel to one of the Cuba
Islands; who answered he had
no one who could undertake it
except himself, and that by
such an Attempt he must
infallibly ruin his whole
Summers Voyage. On this they
assured him they would make
good all Damages that should
accrue on such account, that
they would pay him 400 pieces
of eight, and make him a
present of the Vessel for such
Service as they now requir'd. At
length he consented, they paid
him down 200 pieces of Eight,
and he went on board June the
12th. The Day following being
at Sea and stearing S.S.E. one
of the Pirates being always
arm'd with a Dagger in his
Girdle, ordered him to shape
his course N.W. which gave to
Mr. Vaughan some suspicion of
an ill Design, Design, wherein
he was confirm'd when he
heard of the Carpenter that the
Captain and Mate of the Vessel
were kill'd; which made him
very apprehensive of his own
Danger, especially perceiving
the Frenchman, Cook, and the
Malteeze whispering together,
while the Carpenter was with
the 2 Canary Men on the other
side. He at last enquir'd of the
Frenchman, who being
confident the Capt. would be of
their side, let him, by order of
the Lady, into the Secret, and
discovered the whole Affair.
This being known they entered
into a consulation, and
concluded the safest Measures
were to deliver themselves
from these Villains, asore they
should have any Opportunity to
do them any mischief. In
consequence of which on the
15th Inst. in the Night the Cook
gave one of the Pirates 2 blow
with an Axe, which sever'd his
head from the body; while the
Captain with a Hammer
knock'd the other on the head.
The Carpenter hearing the
Noise, ran up, and kick'd up the
Captain's heels; which gave the
Pirate an opportunity to fall on
him, and wound him with his
Knife: The Frenchman came to
the Captain's assistance, and
with a Handspike knock'd the
Pirate into the Hold, who after
recovering himself, rose up,
and desired to have permission
to leap into the Sea, which he
obtain'd without any great
Difficulty.
These Villains having thus
gain'd the ample reward of their
Treachery, the Captain after a
calm and contrary Winds for 5
days, being in the Gulf of
Florida, with the Lady's
consent, ran into this Harbour;
where the persons have been
examined as aforesaid. There
are several strong Suspicious
and evidence against the
Carpenter, that he was of the
Pirates party; his share of
money being found in his chest
on search made: He is therefore
committed to Goal, to have a
further Trial",nonslave

Pico, who arrived here on Friday last in Twenty one Days from St. Thomas's, we are advis'd, That when he was there (about the latter end of July last) there came in a French Sloop belonging to Martineco, one Myet Master, with Thirty five Men and eight Guns, who had been upon a Trading Voyage on the Coast of Porto Rico, of which the Spaniards having Information, they fitted out a Sloop with about Sixty Men and ten Guns, with strict Orders, if the Frenchmen offered to fire a Gun, to give him on quarters; as soon as the Spaniard came up with the Frenchmen, he fired upon him, which complement was soon answered, which presently drew on broad-side and broad-side, but the Spaniard fired so high that he never touch'd the Frenchmen, whereas he, on the contrary, hull'd the Spaniards several Times, and kill'd and wounded him Eight or Ten Men, upon which finding himself overmatch'd (and being very near the Shoar, and in a Calm) he put some Powder and Shot into a Canoe, with a design to go on Shoar to a small Fort where was mounted Four Guns (whither also was a great Number of Spaniards drawn together to behold the Engagement) and from thence to fire upon him, which the Frenchmen observing he let sly upon the Canoe and put them all a Swiming; after that the Frenchmen boarded the Spanish Sloop and plundered her, and setting her on Fire, disappointed the poor Spaniards of their expected plunder. The French Sloop came into the Harbour of Thomas' s with the Spanish Colours flying under his own, and gave an Account of the Affair as is above related.

Capt. Pico also informs, That after several fruitless attempts to suppress the rebel Negroes at St, John's near that place, (of whose insurrection & murthering the Inhabitants, we formerly mentioned) the Company's Merchant went up to Martineco, to procure some Frenchmen and Indians, who were acquainted with the method of Hunting in the Woods for that purpose, who accordingly came down with two Sloops, each having about one Hundred Men on board, well equip'd for Business upon whose landing; the Negroes engages them, but after they had lost five or six of their Men they fled, and afterwards as the Frenchmen were marching in pursuit of them, they found several of them, to the Number of Forty or Fifty, lying dead, whom they supposed to have kill'd themselves to prevent being taken and tortured as they might expect; but notwithstanding the industrious Searches of the French, about Fifteen of them kept themselves concealed; who, upon the Sloops going away, returned to their Masters Plantations, and to their usual Labour, upon which their Masters agreed to seize them at a certain Hour (left there should be a discovery, and so some of them escape,) which accordingly they did, and sent them to the Fort at St. Thomas's, where they soon had their Tryal, and were condemned to die in several Forms of Torture, (according to the Custom of those Governments,) which was to put in Execution the very Day he left the Island; but two of them to prevent it had put an End to their Lives the night before the intended Execution. It is observable, that one of the Rebels was so hardy, that he would not go in with the rest, but was resolved to kill some body before he was taken, upon which a Company went out and shot him, so an End was put to the melancholy Scene, thad had occasioned so much Trouble and Expence to the poor Planters there.

His Majesty has been pleased to present his Serene Highness the Prince of Orange with the Sum of 10,000l. to defray the Expence his Highness was at in the late Campain upon the Rhine.

'Tis talked now with great Assurance, that his Majesty will give Licence for advancing to the Emperor, by way of Loan, 500,000l. on Security of Quick-silver Mines in Silesia. ---- And that the Affair relating to the Erecting a Civil Government at Gibraltar, is like to take Place; and that a Charter is preparing for that Purpose.

His Majesty has been pleas'd to order, that the Britania, together with twenty-five other Ships of the Line, which were order'd into Harbour, and were only to have their Gunpowder taken on Shore to prevent its receiving Damage, should no be disarm'd, and put into the Docks in order to be refitted.

Affairs on the Rhine are now in such Situation, as if a new Campaign was intended; the Marshal de Noailles being in Motion with 30,000 Men, and a Train of Artillery, for some Enterprize, but what is uncertain; on whose Approach the Germans have abandoned Oppenheim, and are preparing to desert Worms also. The French Parties pillage the Country, even to the very Gates of Manheim; but the Imperialists are likewise in Motion, to defeat their Enterprizes.

The Accounts we receive in relation to the Disposition of the Grand Turk to make Peace with the Persians, or War with the Emperor, vary just as the Weather cock changes. A South Wind constantly sends Letters from France, mentioning positively, that a Treaty is struck up with Thomas Kouli Kan; but a few Points more to the East, give us Advices from Brussels indirect Opposition to the other. Letters from Constantinople, dated the 23d of September, arriv'd Yesterday by the way of Venice, intimate, that however hard the Conditions are, upon which the Persians offer Peace to the Turks, yet the Porte appears resolv'd to accept them, in order to prevent a general Insurrection of the People, who are greatly discontented with the War in Persia; that as the Ignominy of giving back by Treaty all the Conquests obtain'd at so vast an Expence of Blood and Treasure, would incur upon the Grand Seignior the Contempt of his People, and equally expose him to the Hazard of being depos'd, 'twas judged, the Porte, in order to save their Credit, design'd to let the Persians regain them under Colour of Arms; for Thomas Kouli Kan, with a Body of 40,000 Men, was actually advanced towards Erivad, without any Interruption on the part of the Ottoman Army. These Letters add, that the Porte was so exhausted both of Men and Treasure, that it was not believ'd the Grand Seignior could be spirited up to a War against any Christian Powers; the People also talk'd loudly against it, and that the frequeot Audiences the Prime Vizior gives Count Bonneval, and a certain other Person, to whom the Count is only a Tool, were with no other View than to take the latter in for a few Purses, and to render it necessary for the opposite Party to throw in an equal Weight of Gold, in order to keep the Balance even. An Artifice the Prime Ministers at Constantinople often play off successfully.

This Week one of his Majesty's Messengers in Ordinary was dispatched from St. James's with Letters of Importance, to the Right Hon. Sir Robert Walpole in Norfolk: But whether they are such as require his immediate Return from thence, we can't say: however, 'tis the general Opinion, that the War will be continued, and great Pity it is, that the Endeavours and Time that are spent for an Accommodation should be fruitless, and Advantage taken thereof by the Allies to depress the Emperor, and augment their Sea and Land-Forces. ---- 'Tis, amongst other things, remarked, that the Manning of their Fleets was chiefly owing to the English, Scots and Irish Sailors entering into their Service. To prevent which, Measures will be concerted by the Parliament, who are to meet and fit for the Dispatch of Business on the 14th of January, to encourage the British Sailors, the Glory and Safeguard of this Kingdom, that they may be ready, on all Emergencies, for the Service of their Country.

the Affairs of Corsica .

WE the Doge, Governors, and Procurators of the Republic of Genoa, &c. having learnt, that a certain famous Person, dress'd like a Turk, has landed in our Kingdom of Corsica, on the Side of Aleria, where he repair'd with some Ammunitions of War, on board a little Vessel commanded by Capt. Dick, an Englishman; that this Man, though unknown, had yet found Means to insinuate himself with some Chiefs of the Malecontents; who finding their Interest in it, have contriv'd to make it agreeable to the People; that the same Person had distributed Arms among them, some Powder, and several Peices of Gold, and amused them with the Hopes of a speedy and powerful Succour: As all these Circumstances are contrary to the publick Tranquility, and as it imports us to provide therein for the good of our Corsican Subjects, We have thought it proper to inform them of the true Quality and Condition of the Man, conformable to the Proofs and Evidences which we have of them.

He fetches his Original from one of the Cantons of Westphalia, and calls himself Baron Theodore de Neuhoff. He prosesses extraordinary Light in Chymistry, the Cabala, and Astrology; by Means of which Sciences he pretends to have found out the most important Secrets, though he be Nothing in reality but a Vagabond, and in very indifferent Circumstances. In Corsica, he goes by the Name of Theodore: Under the same Name he appeared at Paris, towards the End of the Year 1729; from whence he retired, after having abandon'd his Wife, an Irish Woman by Nation, whom he had married in Spain, and by whom he had one Daughter, whom he abandon'd likewise. Thence running through the World, he disguis'd his Name and Nation. At London he was a German, at Leghorn an Englishman, and at Genoa a Swede; taking one while the Name of Baron de Napoer, and at another that of Smitmer or Nissen, and sometimes that of Schmitberg, as it appears by his pass-ports, and by other authentick Pieces, which have been sent to us from divers Places, and which we have in our Custody.

Under these different Names it is, that he has found Means to live at the Cost of others. It is well known, that about the Year 1727 in Spain, he embezzled the Money which had been advanc'd to him in order to his raising a Regiment of Germans as he had engag'd to do. Having fled from Spain, he put Tricks in divers Places upon English, French, Germans, and many other Persons of different Nations.

Wherever he bubbled People, he took great Care to conceal his Rogueries, which after his Departure appeared plainly: A Letter written by a German Gentleman from Lisbon, on the 20th of February last, is an evident Proof of it.

Some time Since, he borrow'd of the Bankers Jabach at Leghorn, 515 Peices of Eight, which he promis'd to repay at Cologn. His Creditors finding themselves cheated, put him into Prison: He got out in some Months, having by some Artifice procur'd the Master of a Vessel to be bound for him, as it appears by the Account of his Discharge pass'd at Leghorn, on the 6th of September last, in the Presence of Notary John-Baptist Gumano; and in order to his being cur'd of an Illness he contracted in Goal, he was put in the Hospital of St. Bagno in the same Town. From thence he went to Tunis, where he practis'd Physick, and held several secret Conferences with the Chiefs of the Infidels. He manag'd so as to get Arms and Ammunition from them, with which he transported himself into Corsica, accompanied by Christopher, Brother of the Physician Buongiorno at Tunis; and by Three Turks, one of them named Mahomet, formerly a Slave in the Gallies of Tuscany; by Two young Men of Leghorn, Attiaman, and Bondells, Fugitives from their Father's ther's House; and by a Priest of Porto Ferrajo, whom the Missionary Fathers of Tunis thought fit to send at a Distance for good Reasons.

In Consequence of what is said above, and forasmuch as this Man has dar'd to thrust himself into the Government of Corsica, and turn aside our Subjects maliciously from the Fidelity which they owe to their natural Sovereign; since besides, it may be fear'd that a Man whose Conduct and Maxims are so deprav'd, may create great Trouble among our Subjects; we have judg'd it convenient to publish the aforesaid Account, and to declare, as we do declare by this Placart, that the aforesaid pretended Baron de Neuhoff, actual Author of new Insurrections , Seducer of the People, Disturber of the public Tranquility, is guilty of High Treason and Rebellion, and as such, deserving of all the Punishments prescrib'd by our Laws, forbidding all Persons whatever to have any Correspondence or Commerce with him; and declaring worthy of the same Punishments, guilty of Rebellion, and Disturbers of the public Repose, all those who shall lend him any Succour or Assistance, or who shall follow him, in order to encrease the Revolt, and trouble the Quiet of our People.

The Reign of King Theodore,
in Corsica, has been like a
Meteor, unexpected in
Appearance, surprizing in.
Effect, short in Continuance,
cast a great Blaze whilst it
lasted, and vanish'd in a
Moment: From a Brow
wreath'd with Laurel, he is glad
to thrust his Head into any
Bush where he can hide it. His
Soldiers, dispirited, are every
where beaten by the Genoese
Garrisons, who make daily
Sallies upon them, and seize
their Provisions. The Corsicans
which the Baron appointed to
attend in State about his
Person, serve at present only as
Spies, to hinder his making his
Escape. The Letters from that
Island, which are handed hither,
by the way of Holland,
mention, that the Baron finding
some of his Courtiers desert
him, and fancying himself still
a King, determin'd to stop the
Desertion, of the rest, by
hanging up three of the
pretended Rebels in Terrorem,
but that nobody would obey his
Orders, and he had the
Mortification to see Derision in
the Face of every one round
him. As the Affair of the
Succours he promis'd the
Malecontents is discover'd to
be nothing but an Artifice to
support his Credit, 'tis not
doubted but that the Genoese
will take this Opportunity to
strike in with the Dissaffected,
who seem ready to make a
Sacrifice of the Baron, as a sort
of Atonement to the Republick.
The Inhabitants of the Districts
of Nebio and Calenzana in
Corsica, as also those of the
Northern Provinces, seeing the
declining and desperate
Condition of the Malecontents,
have thought it their best way
to submit to the Genoese. As
for Baron de Neuhoffe he
retired to the Middle of the
Island, with those who still
build upon his mountainous
Promises: But they kept a
watchful Eye over him, for fear
he should make his Escape.
The Baron, however, by bribing
his Keepers, found Means to
escape to some Sea-port, where
he now skulks, till he can meet
with a favourable Opportunity
of putting to Sea. These last
Accounts we have from
Leghorn; but the Advices even
from Genoa, are far more
favourable to the Malecontents,
who are said to have lately
maintained an Engagement
with the Genoese, tho'
superiour in Number, for Eight
Hours, with unparallel'd
Bravery; and then being
seasonably reliev'd, they forced
the haughty Republicans,
consisting of above 1000 Men,
to retire with great Loss and
Precipitation.

THERE is a Copy in
Town of the Report of
the Gentlemen
appointed by the
Governor and Council
in Antigua to examine
into the Affair of the late
Conspiracy of the Slaves
there, dated December
30, 1736 Whereby it
appears that after the
Execution of 12 of the
chief Conspirators,
frequent Saturday
Night's Meetings of
great numbers of
Conspirators had been
for a great while held at
several Places and that
by drinking a Health in
Rum or some other
Liquor mixt with Grave
Dirt and some time
Cocks-blood infused an
Oath of Secrecy and
Fidelity had been taken
by many hundred
Slaves, whereof the
Words were various, but
the Tenor was to stand
by and be true to each
other, and to kill the
Whites, Man, Woman
and Child, to assist in
the Execution of this,
when called upon by the
Chiefs, and to suffer
Death rather than
discover That 37 more
were since convicted,
condemned and
executed, 42 proposed to
be banished, and two
were fled from Justice,
and rewards publickly
put upon their Heads, to
take them alive or kill
them in pursuit.
The 13th Paragraph of the said
Report is in the Words
following
As it seems to us agreeable to
the Intent of the last Order of
your Excellency and Council,
that we should report what our
Opinion is as to the Safety of
the Island; we think it will not
be impertinent to touch as
introductory to it, upon what
we think encouraged our Slaves
to attempt our Ruin and
Destruction, and tho' we cannot
be very certain by what
particular Inducement the
Slaves might be brought to set
on foot this inhuman Plot; yet
we may say with some
Certainty that next to hopes of
Freedom, the greatest was the
inequality of Numbers of white
and black Neither can we lay
down Rules to remedy this
Evil, but think it would be
greatly helped, if Gentlemen
resided on their own Estate
here, and that Men of the best
Figures and Fortune would not
so generally put Slights upon
the Commissions of the Peace
and Militia: and that Slaves
were disabled form being
Handicraft Tradesmen,
Overseers, Drivers or Distillers,
Shop-keepers or Hawkers and
Pedlars or Sailors, nor suffered
to keep Horses, nor to work our
for themselves, and that more
of our menial Servants, and our
wet and dry Nurses were to be
Whites and no Fidlers for gain
but Whites to be suffered, and
that generally more
Encouragement should be
given to Whites by our Laws
and Practice, and less to Slaves,
and our present wholesome
Laws, for governing of our
Slaves vigourously executed
______How far we may be in
danger still from this last
Conspiracy, we cannot
determine, since undoubtedly
there are Hundreds by us
undiscovered, who have bound
themselves by impious Oaths to
destroy us, Man, Woman and
Child: from hence it may be
concluded, what must be the
Spirit and Inclinations of the
Slaves, and how weak and vain
it would be in us to say the
Country is in Safety, or to
advice your Excellency to put a
Stop to any further Inquiry.
The Conclusion is as follows.
We cannot look upon this our
Report as complete, or offer as
much, till we have done Justice
to our Brother Robert
Arbuthnot Esq; whose Modesty
will not, we find, suffer him to
subscribe to Truths, which
happen to be so advantageous
to his Character and so
meritorious as they must be
thought in the Eyes of this
Country. At a Time when we
were in a profound Lethargy as
to any Apprehensions of
Danger from our Slaves, this
Gentleman took the Alarm at
Circumstances which pass'd
unobserved by us all, tho' 'tis
now plain they are too weighty
to be neglected. The Disparity
of the Numbers between the
white Inhabitants of this Island
and the Slaves he observed
long since, and mentioned it as
too great to be balanced or
rendered unhurtful by any thing
but the Strictest Discipline over
them, or which he saw so little;
on the Contrary so much
Licenciousness amongst them
as to receive great Uneasiness
from it: And indeed as a
Magistrate for the Town of St.
John, had always discouraged
and severely punished
Delinquents whenever
complained of. His well
grounded Apprehensions mov'd
him to give strict Orders to
Constables and other Peace
Officers to look narrowly into
the Behaviour of the Negroes,
and upon the Encouragement
and Invitation which he gave
for Intelligence he was soon
furnished with sufficient
Grounds to found upon it those
Information, which being laid
before your Excellency
enduced such Measures, as
hitherto secured our Lives and
Properties We submit therefore
whether, under God, the
Preservation of all that is dear
to us be not in a great Measure
owing to the Perspicacity and
Discretion of this Gentleman.

we gave an Account of a
Plot of the Slaves, against
the white People in
Antigua; and we have
now the following more
particular Account, viz.
Extract of a Letter from
Antigua, Oct. 24.
'Here has been a general Stop
to all Business, occasioned by
the happy Discovery of an
accused Negro Plot, which
should have been perpetrated
on the 11th Instant, the
Anniversary of the King's
Coronation, on which Day the
General usually gives a
handsome Ball to the
Gentlemen and Ladies of the
whole Island; but this was
postpon'd 'till the 30th Instant,
upon Account of the Death of
the General's Son at St.
Christophers some little Time
ago: This was the only
Preservative to all our Lives.
The Plot was thus, viz. One
Court, a Negro Man belonging
to Thomas Kirby, Esq; was the
chief Person in this Affair;
Tomboy, a Negro Man
belonging to Mr. Thomas
Hanston; and Hercules, a
Negro Man belonging to Mr.
John Christophers, were to
have been this King Courts
head Generals; and while the
Gentlemen and Ladies were
diverting themselves at the
Ball, which was to have been
held at Mr. Christopher
Dunbar's new House, they were
to convey a great Quantity of
Gun-powder into the Cellar,
and blow the House up: At the
same Time, this King Court,
Tomboy, and Hercules, were to
head a Party of Font Hundred
Men each; one from the East
End of the Town, one from
Otter's Pasture, and one from
Morgan's Pasture, all armed
with Cutlasses, and to fall on
all the Whites in the Town,
Men, Women, and Children,
without Reserve, at the same
Time the House blew up, which
was to be a general Signal to
the other Parts of the Island,
(for they were to place
themselves, or at least look out
on several Eminencies, which,
with a false Fire they were to
make at each Place) was to
convey the Signal through the
Island; then the Negros of each
Plantation were to rise and
destroy all the Whites in their
respective Districts, and so
have made themselves sole
Masters of the Island. How this
happy Discovery was made, is
hardly to be accounted for but
some kind Hand of Providence
induc'd the Magistrates to
enquire more strictly into their
Proceedings than usually they
had done, for playingatDice,
&c. which was contrary to the
wholesome Laws of this Island,
they still discover'd more and
more, till at last this Court,
Tomboy, and Hercules being
suspected, for former Crimes
and high Misdemeaners, were
taken up, and after some strict
Examination, found sufficient
Cause to commit them; and still
more and more Evidences
appearing against them, they
were at length convicted on the
19th Instant at Night. The Day
following, King Court was
brought to the Place of

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Lewis Timothy,1737_04_23,"April 23, 1737",1737,"We gave our Readers an
Account of a Negro Plot
in Antigua, which was
happily discover'd
before it was put in

We have since the following
particulars from a Gentleman in
that Island, by a Letter dated
Dec. 13. Viz.
That after the above
Executions, the General and
Inhabitants thinking all Safe,
dismissed the Troops; but as
Providence would have it, that

seeing his Master (Maj.
Nuegent) come home, went to

a single Haircut of his Head,
and said, you do no more than
so; but could not accuse
Particulars. This occasioned the
taking up two or three

a much deeper Plot, but they
were not thoroughly in the
secret, and if they would come
to the Bottom, they must be yet
more severe: Which piece of
Negro Advice was taken, and
four Persons proved to be in the
first Plot, hung up in Chains
alive, some of which Died in
about 50 Hours, only one
(which was Coll. Morgan's
Ned) survived 8 Days and
Nights: This terrible the others
in Custody, who were kept
apart, so that they made the
following Confession, viz. That
Court (who was a Cormantce)
had begun the Design, and had
had Entertainments in several
Places, on the Island, to draw in
the Negroes that were the Top-
Tradesmen and Born in the
Island (commonly called
Creoles) to his Plot, which they
fell into; but with a different
View to what he apprehended:
For they swore to serve him in
Massacreeing all the white
People, and making him King;
But then among themselves,
carried on a secret Plot, which
was, that as soon as they had
accomplished that, to Murder
him and all the rest of the
Cormantees, and set up a King
of their own; so that Court, his
Generals and Prime Minister
being Executed, affected them
no more than the Loss of so
many Hands; they still went on
with their Design, intending to
execute it on the Christmas
Holidays, when by Law they
are to have three Days allowed
them.
As most of these were the
favorite Negroes, brought up in
the Families, which laid this
Scheme, so they could carry it
on with greater secrecy, many
of the Heads being capable of
Writing and Reading, and had
been taught the Christian
Religion conformable to the
frequent Admonition of our
worthy Diocesan the Bishop of
London, and therefore in
Swearing the Multitude into
their Scheme, they swore them
and administered the Sacrament
to all such as professed
themselves Christians
according to the Rites of the
Bishop's Church, the others
they swore according to their
several Country Forms; which
gives us a Specimen of what
may be expected from
Converting Negroes. Mr.
Martin's Tony and Coll.
Morgan's Ned (who was fine
Mason) took upon them this
Office: Tony was broke on the

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Lewis Timothy,1737_07_09,"July  9, 1737",1737,"Copy a Letter from a
Secretary of one of the
Ambassadors at the
Porte. IN order to satisfy
your Curiously about
Thamas Kouli Kan, I
shall now acquaint you
with what I know of
him, and you may
depend on it that what I
tell you is Authentick.
Thamas, Kouli Kan, was
born at Ascheir in
Chorazan, a Province of
Persia, His Father was a
Shepherd, which
Profession the Son too
followed for some Time,
till he took a Dislike to
it, from a rising
Ambition to make
himself more
considerable in the
World; and then it was,
that he stole 700 Sheep
from his Father, which
he sold, and with the
Money, listed a Gang of
resolute Banditti, of
whom he put himself at
the Head, and then
plundered several
Caravans, with the
Booty whereof he
enrich'd himself very
much.
After having carried on the
Trade of a common
Highwayman for 7 Years, he
went to the Province of
Muzandran, to which the King
Schach Hussein, had sent his
Son, the Prince Thamas, for
Security, before he was obliged
to yield up Ispahan to the
Rebels. The said King being
afterwards put to Death,
Thamas Kouli Kan, who, by
this Time, had 5000 Men under
his Command, offer'd them,
together with his Treasures, to
Prince Thamas, to restore him
to the Throne of his Ancestors;
engaging, at the same Time,
that he wou'd give him his
Head, if he did not succeed in
his Enterprize; provided, that in
case of such Success, the
Prince, when he became King,
would declare him his Prime
Minister. The Prince consented
to whatever he ask'd, such was
his entire Confidence in
Thamas Kouli Kan, who, to
give him the stronger Proof of
his Attachment, assum'd this
new Name, which signifies, the
Slave of Schach Thamas;
whereas he went before by the
Name of Nadir Kouli. I owe
you, Sir, we have had good
Laughing here at the Scottish
Termination, pretended to be
discovered in the Name Kouli
Kan; and then the little
Romance with which 'twas
adorn'd, was so pat, that
nothing could be better hit off.
The first Thing that Kouli Kan
did, after having raised a very
great Body of Troops, was the
driving of the Rebels from
Mached; after which, he
reduced the Province of Heart,
and carried the Governor's
Head to Prince Thamas, as a
Trophy of his Victory.
His Army being now become
more powerful, he besieged and
took Isahan, and reduced the
Aghuans, a rebellious Nation,
who had subdued almost all
Persia He had the Policy to
carry Prince Thamas with him
in several of his Expeditions to
give the more Reason to think,
that he only acted for that
Prince. The Bravery of Kouli
Kan, his good Treatment of the
Soldiery, and the Generosity
with which he rewarded them,
having procured him their
entire Confidence, he took that
Opportunity to seize the
Government, on Pretence, that
Prince Thamas was incapable
of Governing. In fine, his
Ambition, or rather Vanity,
knowing no Bounds, about a
Year ago, he got himself
declared King of Persia, by the
principal Adherents of his
Party; but this Advancement,
instead of establishing his
Authority, must rather tend to
weaken it. He was beloved as
the Defender to him, that 'tis
now under his pompous Title of
King. As he has reach'd to the
Throne by Usurpation, he has
had Recourse to Wickedness, to
secure himself in the
Possession of it. He has put
Prince Thamas, and all the
Princes of the Persian Royal
Family to Death, as well as
several Persian Lords, of
whom he had a Jealously He
has taken the Title of Schach
Nadir, and upon the Money
coined with his Dye, he has put

MY long and tedious Indisposition has prevented furnishing you in Time with particular Remarks on a Letter from Antigua, dated December 13, which you have inserted in your Gazette No. 169. which gives a deplorable Account of the miserable Circumstances that Island labours under from their African & Creolian Tribe. I heartily symphatize with them, and wish it in my Power to extricate them for their Distress. Yet I am satisfied a Method may be found to their Advantage, superiour to what is practized with Them, or among Us, that will effectually answer Their and Our End, (if a superiour Power don't interpose,) and prevent what Patrolls and other Guards (tho' necessary in their Place) cannot.

I'm sorry to find the Author of that Letter so angry with, and incens'd against the Christian ad holesome Admonitions of their ghostly Father the Bishop of London; who only admonished and advised them to instruct those poor miserable Creatures whose Unhappiness it is to be under the heavy Yoke of Task-Masters, in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, that thereby they may be qualified to discharge their Duty aright, both towards God and Man. This I think every one that is conversant with the Scripture, and acquainted with the Principles of Our most holy Religion, will concur with me, in saying, that it is no more than the Reasonable Service of all those that are possess'd of them. I'm sure they are intelligible beings, and have Souls to save or lose as well as we: Therefore demand that some Care may be taken of their Souls, whilst they are in Bondage, that so, when they come to be set at Liberty by the grim Serjeant of the Grave, they may have a Place of Rest assign'd them, where Barbarity and Cruelty will have no Admittance.

Strange! very strange it is, that to instruct those poor Creatures in the Knowledge of Life and Salvation in and through a Mediator, should involve and plunge us into those manifold Dangers, that threaten our Destruction. Can we suppose that God ever design'd Religion for such an End? God forbid! Yet our Author, (if I take him right) would fain persuade us to believe, that to instruct them in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, is the only way to destroy ourselves.

Our Author, after he hath been giving us an Account of the Circumstances of their Island, and their Conformity to the Bishop's Admonition, concludes: "" which gives ""us a Specimen of what may be expected ""from converting Negroes. "" As if he had said, 'Tis true, we have often been admonished by our worthy Diocesan, of our Duty, and in Obedience to him, have instructed our Slaves in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion; but what is the consequence of this? Why, Insurrection , Murder and Blood, and what not besides! This is what may be expected from converting Negroes ! 'Tis surprizing, that a Christian, or nay on that bears the Name, should load it with such Infamy.

Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the Streets of Askelon!

It were necessary, in the first Place, to lay the Storm, by making the Citizens intirely secure, to recall all those who are removed out of the City, and particularly all the Members of the Little and Grand Council; and to prohibit, under the severest Penalties, all Acts of Violence, Oppression, and Injury, either betwixt private Persons, or between the Parties.'

The Person lately mentioned to be in Trouble at Paris, for having a Lodge of Free-Masons at his House is said to be one Chapelot, a Wine-Merchant, who was fined 1000 Livres for the said Offence, and had his Shop shut and walled up.

Some Letters from Vienna say, that a Plague rages at Bender, and that the Turks therefore talk of leaving the Place.",nonslave

'We have a Consimation that the Court has received a Courier form Poland, with News that a Body of 30,000 Russians, commanded by General Lacy, has been routed and cut to Pieces by the Turks, who have also taken all their Cannon and Baggage, and were gone in Pursuit of the Fugitives. it is added that General Lacy is Taken Prisoner.' We fancy our Readers will suspend their Belief of this Piece of news until it comes from a less suspected Quarter, this being the third Time, since Spring, that the A la main has cut the Russian Army, under the Veldt-arshal Lacy, to Pieces by Turkish Scimitars.

Letters from Constantinople, by the Way of Venice, report, that the Grand Seignior and the whole Divan are greatly inclin'd to carry on the War with Russia; that the taking of Oczakow by the Russian Army had inrag'd the Inhabitants of Constantinople to such a Degree, that there had been an Insurrection in that City; that the Shops were shut up, and the People searing the wrost had stor'd themselves with Provisions for many Days; that the Government in order to appease the Tumult, had thrown the Blame upon the Grand Vizir, and remov'd him from his Employment; but that the Populace, not content with a single Sacrifice, had violently diagg'd two Russian Officers, who were Prisoners, out of their Apartments, and cut off their Heads.

Letters from Naples say, that his Sicillian Majesty is resolv'd to send the Collar of his new Order of St. Januarius to the Emperor. Those Letters add, that a Tartane is fail'd from thence, with Powder, Ball, and other war-like Stores for the Island of Corsica.

From Genoa we hear, that the French Commissary of Stores and Provisions, M. Peloux, arrived there the 26th of last Month, and was magnificently treated next Day by M. Brignole, whom that Republick has nam'd her Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of France. It is further said, that the Commissary is to proceed directly to Corsica, in order to prepare Provisions for the Troops which France is sending to that island. This squares with the Article from Leghorn.

By a private Letter from Holland we are advis'd, 'That Mr. Walpole continues to hold private Conferences with the Grand Pensionary and the other Ministers of the State, from whence, and from other Intimations, the French Court concludes that as Alliance is forming amongst the protestant Powers in Europe. In order to prevent the Northern Courts from entring into this Alliance, the Departure of the Count de St. Seveirn, nominated Embassador to the King of Sweden, will be much sooner than was expected. This Embassador it's said, has Orders to offer that Prince of Subsidy of 1500,000 Florins per Annum, and to propose an Association between the French East-India Company and that of Sweden for the more effectually carrying on the Chinese Trade; and M. de Chavigni has Orders to make a Proposition of the like Nature to the Court of Denmark, differing only in the Value of the Subsidy, which is to be but 800,000 Flories.'

'The Court of France was under a Necessity, at this Time, of not only proposing a Subsidy to Sweden, but also some considerable Advantages in Regard to the Swedish Commerce, in order to regain the Confidence of that Court, which France had well high forfeited, by sing to ready and execute a Treaty of Subsidy concluded 2 Years ago between Sweden and the Most Christian King, and which the Cardinal, soon after having made Peace with the Emperor, thought might safely be disregarded. This piece of saving Policy will undoubredly put the Court of Sweden on its Gaurd, and perhaps make it more difficult for the French to being about their Designs than some People imagine: Nothing is more certain, than that extraordinary Things have been effected by the fine Speeches and enticing Promises of that Court; one of which was its drawing the State, General into the Ambre of the Neutraluy, which so much irritated the Court of Vienna against their High Mightinesses, as to make it, in a great Measure, forget all that had been done for it in the last War with Lewis XIV. And at present France, for getting its Protestations of inviolable Friendship to the Republick, is even assisting the Emperor to punish it for what it would not have done but through the Instigation of that Crown, and is favouring the Commerce of the Northern Powers, in direct Opposition to that of the Dutch. It is likewise Matter of Doubt whether France does not underhand stir up the Coals of Contention between Great Britain, this State, and the Court of Spain, which, if it could effect, would not only turn greatly to the Advantage of its trading Subjects; but Spain being thus employ'd, the Authority of the new Grand Duck, of which France is Guarantee, would be establish'd Besides, a Year at Sea would so effectually exhaust Spain of its Treasure, that she would be unable for a considerable Time to prosecute any Enterprizes in Italy. Nothing appears so effectual for drawing the Affairs so the Republick out of the critical Situation in which they are, as the making larger Offers to the Northern Princes, than have already been made.'

'The Promotion of General Officers begins again to be brought of the Taps. The Deputies of Friesland and Groningen have repeated the Declaration already made by the States of those Provinces, that they will not consent to such Promotion, but on Condition that the Prince of Orange be appointed General of Foot. Those two Provinces expected that of Guelderland would have been of the same Opinion; which join'd with the Voices of half the Members which compose the States of Uttecht, would have made an equal Division among the States for an against the Prince of Orange: But, at a Time when it was least expected, the Deputies of Guelderland declar'd that they had Orders to be of the same Sentiments with the Provinces of Holland, Zealand, and Overyssel, with Respect to the Promotion; by which it is not intended to make any higher one than that of Lieutenant-Generals, and consequently exclude the Prince of Orange from being made General of Foot, as yet. This Conduct of the Province of Guelderland seems the more extraordinary, that Province having always appear'd most zealous to promote the Price of Orange's Interest on all Occasions. 'Tis not doubted but that the Promotion of the Lieutenant Generals will take Place forthwith.'",nonslave

A Sudden Elevation from the
Depths of Obscurity to a Sstate
of Power and Eminence, and a
quick Remove from the lowest
Ebb of Fortune to the
Possession of a plentiful Estate,
are, perhaps, the greatest
Misfortune that can befal a
Man of an ambitious Temper.
His exalted Station is apt to
inspire him with Insolence and
Contempt towards those who
move in a lower Sphere, to
make his Head turn giddy, and
to hasten his Downfal from the
highest Pinacle of Power, and
the higher he was raised above
the common Level, the less is
his Fall lamented, and the more
contemptible does he look at
the Bottom. His Wealth, tho'
neither the Effect of his own
Prudence nor industry, puffs
him up too much, and makes
him forget himself as well as
his former narrow
Circumstances. The only

in Don ... in the Kingdom of
Arragon, in the reign of King

Forwardness, and undaunted [

mighty Zeal for the Service of
the Prince, and prevailed with
the Cortes, by his Noise and
Vociferation, ( for reasoning
was not his Talent) to grant the
Donative, as they then called it.
Upon the Death of Maximillan,
the Emperor, King Charles,
going down into Germany, to
secure his Title to the Empire,
appointed Don Antonio Prisrs
to preside over the Province of
Catahula; and tho' this
Gentleman was an hearty
Sollicitor with the Widow in
Behalf of Don [ ], and to whom
alone he owed his Wealth and
present Figure; yet he made
him a very ungrateful Return,
opposed his Interest in the
Cortes with the utmost
Vehemence, and endeavoured
to get him removed from his
Presidentship. The King upon
his Return, nominated Don [ ]
to be Governour of Catahula,
under whose Administration
Don Roberto ... ( for I must
translate his Name for the
Benefit of the English Reader)
had the good Fortune to be
elected Procurator again. In this
Cortes he shewed himself to be
a perfect Emblem of
Inconsistency; one Day he was
a warm Espouser of the
Governour's Cause, another, he
was loud and elamorous against
him; he often reproached the
Conduct of the Governour, in
his Absence, and as constantly
flatter'd him to his Face; and all
this under Pretence of Zeal for
the Liberties and Properties of
the People. During his
Procuratorship, he involved his
Estate very far in Debt; and, in
order to retrieve it, he applied
to the Governour to be made an
Alsade, that is, a Judge, or
Dispenser of Justice. He had
but little Hopes of Success,
even after many repeated
Solicitations; but continuing to
seize and importune the
Governour, who, being a good
natured Man, and knowing him
to be impacable in his
Resentments, capable of
forming Parties against him,
and giving him much
Disturbance in the
Administration, was at last
forced into a Compliance, tho'
he knew at the same Time, that

important Office, and the less [

for it.
Having obtained his Promotion
(which he owed to his
Dishonour, as well as his
Favour to his [ ] ) He retired
into the Country, and set up a
little Shop, tho' he had nothing
[ ] for Sale but small Scraps of
coarse Paper, with his own
Hand and Seal affixed to each
of them His yearly [ ] in the
Opinion of every Body that
knew him, was not sufficient, at

and yet, in a Years Time, he
paid off his Debts, set up a fine
Equipage, and made several [ ]
Purchases. He carried a high
Hand over his Neighbours and
valued himself so on Account
of his [ ] and Preferment, that
he concluded [ ] an undoubted
Proheminence over them; as if
Power could inspire Wisdom,
or Pelf add any thing to a Man's
real Merit! He [ ] as a petty [ ],
and carried a more absolute ...
Coffers, than a half Dozen of
the best Horses in the
Neighbourhood could be sold
for at Market. Nay, the very
Cats and Dogs, dead or alive,
helped to encrease his
Revenue; and I defy any Man
to five an Instance, wherein
that unlimited Prince Charles
the 5th, exercised such arbitrary
Power, even after he had
reduced his rebellious Subjects
to their wonted Fealty and
Allegiance.
He was reckoned, by some
weak People, to be rather a
Merciful than an upright [ ],
because few Offences, were
corrected by him in Proportion
to their Magnitude. Instead of
punishing every Violation of
the Laws, according to his Oath
of Office, He rather encouraged
it, and kept his Emissaries, or
underhand-Swearers, In every
Corner, to set People together
by the Ears; and whoever had
the best Heels came the best
oft; for Judgment was always
given in Favour of the first
Complainanty, and by this Craft
he got his wealth, he fattened
and grew rich by Cruelty and
Oppression, and amassed
together immense Heaps of
Wealth by Wrangling and
Contentio; but as soon as his
Crimes came to be publickly
known, all Ranks and Degrees
of Men complained of his
arbitrary Proceedings, and a
general Spirit of Resentment
was raised against him. The
Clamour was so universal, that
he dreaded some Accusations
would be lodged against him,
but he encouraged himself with
this Consideration that he
could, with the Highwaymen in
Shakespear, make the wicked
Prize itself buy off the [ ] And
well may he apply some Part of
his unjust Gain to support him
in an Office, which sets him in
a more advantageous Point of
Light, and makes him cut a
better Figure than any of his
Equals, or even Superiours in
Fortune.
Several Gentlemen, who had
felt the Smart of his Rod, met
one Night by Appointment, in
order to concert Measures how
they might screen themselves
from the Lashes of this Mock
Prince. Don Pristino Alvarez
was the first that entered upon
the Subject, and spoke to the
following Effect. ""Gentlemen,
said he, I think no Man should
be entrusted with the Execution
of the Laws, but Men of known
Probity and Interest, whose
Integrity is above all
Corruption, and whose Fortune
is above all Temptation; and
consequently it must be a great
Over-sight (to say no worse for
it) in any Government to
promote an indigent Upstart to
an Office of Power, and arm
him with Authority to distress
his Fellow subjects; for it will
be a vain Attempt in any Man
in private Life and low
Circumstances, either to sue for
Redress under the greatest
Grievances, or to implead one
who is above the ordinary
Remedies of Law. But it is still
more inexcusable to advance a
wicked Fellow, who neither
fears God nor Man, and who
every Day tramples all Laws
human and divine under his
Feet, to be Judge of my Life
and Property; for if an Alcade
dishonours his Maker in every
Breath, he will not scruple, if
he has a handsome
Opportunity, of deceiving me;
or if he tells a Lye, and swears
to it for nothing (which is
commonly the Case) he will
hardly buggle at Perjury, when
it redounds to his Advantage I
could tamely submit to this
irksome Yoke, under which we
have so long groaned, if I
thought my Misery could
contribute to the general
Welfare of human Society; but
the Publick can reap no Benefit
from seeing me fettered down
in Chains, beyond all Hopes of
Redemption, by the Pest of
Mankind, and an Enemy to
God and all Goodness, Let us
all therefore join in an humble
Petition to the Government to
have this domineering Alcade
removed from his Office. We
have a Right to be heard, and to
be protected from Wrong. It is
well known that he makes a
Livelihood of Justice, and that
all Professions, from his
Example, are likely to empty
themselves into the Office of
Alcade; and indeed it is a
comfortable Retreat for Spend
thrifts, Rakes, Vagabonds,
Gamesters and Sharpers, in
which they may parch up their
broken Fortunes, tho' in a

The Virginia Gazette,1,William Parks,1738_05_12,"May 12, 1738",1738,"LETTERS from
Constantinople say, That
the Grand Seignor has
declared, in an
extraordinary Divan,
that it being not
consistent with his
Honour to leave
Oczakow in Possession
of Russia, he had
resolved to retake it, cost
what it will; and that, if
needs must, he would
sacrifice part of his own
Treasure for that End.
And they add, That
being absolutely
resolved upon it, without
asking the Orders to the
Army to detach a great
Body of Troops towards
that Place.
The Turkish Troops, in Order to
be forced to discharge their
Duty, are obliged to take a new
Oath, drawn up by the Multi,
wherein they declare, That if
they do not fight to the last
Drop of their Blood, for the
Maintenance of the Glory of
the Ottoman Arms, they will
consent not only to be punished
upon Earth, but also after
Death, and to be forever
deprived of the Felicity of the
true Believers, and of the
Happiness of seeing the Great
Prospect Mahomet in Heaven.
From some late Accounts, there
seems to be Ground to believe
that a new Congress will
speedily be held for restoring
Peace between the Ottoman
Empire and the Empires of
Germany and Russia; for from
Petersburg we hear, that Mr.
Rondeau, the British Minister,
and Mr. Zwart, the Dutch
Minister, at that Court, have,
with the Czarina's Leave, wrote
respectively to Sir Everard
Fawkener, Ambassador from
the king of Great-Britain, and
Mr. Kalkoen, Ambassador from
the States-General of the
United provinces, to the
Ottoman porte, that the
Empress of Russia has
excepted the Mediation of his
Britannick Majesty, and their
High Mightinesses, in
Conjunction with that of
France, for bringing about a
peace. And from
Constantinople we hear that the
Marquiss de Villeneuve, the
French Ambassador at the Port.
together with the said Sir
Everard, Fawkener, and Mr.
Kalkoen, have had a
Conference with the Kamaikan,
at with he declared to them,
that the Grand Seignior had
accepted the Mediation of
France, Great-Britain, and
Holland, for bringing about an
Accommodation between his
Sublime Highness, and the
powers he was then at War
with.
Towards the latter End of last
Month, the World was surpriz'd
with the News of a Marriage
being concluded between the
Don Carlos, king of the Two
Sicilies, and the Princess Royal
of Poland, born at Dresden,
Sept. 13, O.S. 1724. This
Marriage is by some ascribed
to a political View; and that it is
to be the Basis of a new Treaty
between the Counts of Vienna,
Madrid, and Naples; by which
the Emperor is is to be
powerfully assisted in his War
against the Turks: But others
ascribe it to Love only, by
telling us that the Queen of
Spain having sent for the
Pictures of Four Princesses,
qualified by their Age and Birth
to marry the king her Son,
caused them to be put up in his
Closet, when he was out a
Hunting; and that upon his
Return, he immediately took
Notice of the Four new Pictures
put up in this Closet;
whereupon of his Ministers,
intrusted by the Queen of Spain
for that Purpose, asked him,
which of those Four young
Ladies he thought the
handsomest, without telling
him who the Originals were?
The young Monarch upon this
fixed his Eye upon the Picture
of the Princes Royal of Poland,
and said, were he to take
Choice, the Lady whose Picture
that was, should be a Wise for
him. Then says the Minister, if
your Majesty pleases to turn to
the back Side of the Picture,
you'll see whose it is.
Whereupon he eagerly turn'd
the back Side, and upon finding
Mary-Amelia Princess Royal of
Poland wrote upon it, he
presently said, she shall be my
Queen, and this Instant I'll
write my Mind to the King my
Father, and Queen my Mother.
They write from Naples, that
upon New Year's Day when the
King was receiving the
Compliments of the Nobility,
he declared his Marriage in
these Terms, I inform you that I
have chosen for my Consort
and Companion, the Princess
Royal of Poland, the Electoral
Princess of Saxony. The Lord
immediately expressed their
Joy for the Union, and in the
Evening there was a general
Discharge of the Cannon of the
Castles, and the Ships in the
Harbour, and Illumination
throughout the whole City; the
next Day, the King attended by
the whole Court, went to the
Cathedral Church, where To
Deum was sung to Musick, the
Streets though which he passed
being filled with infinite
Crouds of People, who all
testified their Joy upon this
Occasion with loud
Acclamations. The same Letter
add, that some Days before a
very extraordinary
Phoenomenon had appeared in
the Air, over that City. The
Heavens appeared to be fiery
red, and near the Zenith was
seen a Globe of Fire, which
continued without Motion for
the Space of Two Hours, and
then on a sudden, burn with a
Notice as a Clap of Thunder.
It would seem either that the
French are not serious in their
Design of assisting the Genoese
to reduce the Island of Corsica,
or that the Malecontents of that
Island are mad; for they seem
to be so little afraid of being
gain reduced under the Power
of the Genoese, that having
lately taken a Felucca with 21
Men on board, belonging to the
Genoese, they hung them all up
in Sight of the Garrison of
Bastia, in Revenge for the
Genoese having lately hang'd
some of their Men.
The brave Corsicans continue
to receive frequent Assistant
from their King. On the 15th of
January, a Vessel without
Colours brought thither several
of his Confidents and
Domesticks, together with 6
Foreign Officers, a great many
Chests fill'd with Arms, both
mounted and unmounted, and
100 Tons of Powder, Lead,
Iron, Steel, and other
Ammunition. They deliver'd
Letters from Theodore to the
chief Men of the Country, who
were so pleased with the
Contents, that they order'd Te
Deum to be sung, and Bonfires
and Illuminations to be made
all over the Island About a
Week afterwards landed Count
Colonna, who is much esteem'd
there, and with him 14 German
Officers, and more
Ammunition. It is reported, that
he has brought along with him
the necessary Orders for
making an Attempt upon
Bastia: As to the Place of
Theodore's Residence at
present, it is a Mystery
unknown to every Body but the
Four Principal Chiess. The
week after Colonna's Arrival,
he made an Attack on the
Fortress in the Isola, which
continued with great Briskness
and Obstinacy on both Sides,
until at last the Genoese were
obliged to surrender at
Disercrion. The Assailants lost;
tenants and 72 Soldiers, and
only 49 of the Garrison
remain'd alive: The Officer
who commanded it, writes to
the Marquis de Rivarola at
Bastia, that he and his 49 Men
are Prisoners of War, and are
treated with great Humanity by
the Malecontents; but that his
Lieutenant, a Corsican by
Birth, being discover'd to be
one of those concern'd in a
Conspiracy against the Life of
the Baron de Newhoff a little
Time after his Arrival in the
Island, had but a Quarter of an
Hour allow'd him to prepare
himself for Death; that his
execution had been very cruel;
that they begun it cutting out
his Tongue, and chopping off
his Hand; that they then
fastened him to the Top of a
Post, placed in the midst of a
heap of Wood built up as for a
Bonfire, and that in this manner
they burnt him alive. The
Officer adds, that he and his 49
men were forced to be present
at the Execution; after which
Count Colonna address'd
himself to the Officer and his
Men in the following Words:
'The Lieutenant is punished
with so much Rigour, for
having not only been a perjured
Traitor to his King, but also a
Rebel to his Country. As to
you, we intend to treat you as
Prisoners of War, and with the

From Vienna, That the real End
of the Journey which the
marquis de Botta has taken to
Petersburg, is to represent at
the Russian Court, that the
Situation of Affairs in Hungry
will not permit the Emperor to
defer any longer the
Conclusion of a Suspension of
Arms with the Ottoman Porte:
He has it likewise in
Commission to acquaint that
Court, that upon the strictest
Examination in Count
Seckendorff's Affair, this Lord
has not been guilty of any
Capital Crime; and that
therefore the Imperial Court
will be indispensably obliged to
set him at Liberty, This seems
intirely to agree with what has
been before said in his Affair,
that the long Confinement of
that General was partly the
Effect of the ill Will which the
Court of Russia bore him.
Count Fuenclara, Ambassador
from Spain, has receiv'd
considerable Remittances from
his Court, to defray the
Expences of his Journey to
Dresden, where he intends to
go the Latter End of this Month
(Jan.) It's said, that the Value of
the Presents that his Excellency
is to make to the Princes Royal,
in the Name of their Catholick
Majesties and of the King of
the Two Sieilies, amounts to
more than 700,000 Florins.
After this Ambassador shall
have conducted the Royal
Spouse of the Kingdom of
Naples, he will return hither,
(Vienna) and continue to
exercise the Functions of his
Employment.

Expences of another

Countries, the Emperor will
draw several Millions of
Florins from the Revenue of

Dominions, The Heads of

Religion, and Fidelity and

The Court of Vienna has not
made the bullying Bashaw of
Zwornick more ridiculous, by
publishing his rodomontade
Letter to the Governor of
Belgrade, than the Russian
Court has render'd eminent the
Seraskier of Oczakow, now a
Prisoner at Petersburg. This last
founds loudly the Praise of that
Officer's distinguishing Talents,
who, we are told, has by a
singular Address and
uncommon Affability, laid the
best Foundation for a Peace
between the Empress and the
Porte. In short, he has greatly
lessened the Rancour which
subsisted between the Two
Empires, and gone great
Lengths towards making them
think favourable of each other.
So that how great an Evil
soever the port might think the
Loss a the Seraskier, yet the
greatest Good is likely to acrue
from it, for notwistanding the
Propositions sent by his

Price; one of the Inhabitants
being apply'd to for that

lend his Horse; and perceiving
that it would be taken by Force,
he kill'd it, saying, he chose
rather to lose every Thing, than
to do the French any Service;
for which he was sent to Prison
and put into a Dungeon. This
Animosity of the Inhabitants
appears the more strange,
because the French spend much
Money, observe an exact
Discipline, and were it not for
some Gallantries, neither the

therefore of the Corsicans of

to the French, mush arise from
their being prevented by them
from acting like the rest of their
Country Folks. Some who have
been made Prisoners by the
Rebels relate, that every one of
them always goes arm'd with a
Musket, two or more Pistols,

that there are very frequently

THE Letter Writer proceeds to
tell us, that he is surprized, this
Doctrine of Original Sin should
begin to be exploded, when a
publick Representation of
Persons is the general Principle
upon which the World now acts
in all national Affairs, and from
whence alone the Justice of
them must in his Opinion
emerge. If the Letter-Writer had
been something more large on
this Head, his Meaning would
in my Opinion have been
clearer, and the Justice and
Inconclusiveness of his
Reasoning would have much
more plainly appeared.
However, what I take to be his
Meaning, is this, that the
Doctrine of Original Sin may
be justified; if we suppose
Adam to be our publick
Representative, and that 'tis
surprizing the Doctrine of a
publick Representative should
be called in Question, when we
admit and allow of it by our
Practice in sending Persons to
represent us in our Parliaments,
and Assemblies. This, or
something like it, is what I take
it the Letter Writer meant,
when he tells us, a publick
Representation of Persons is
the general Principle upon
which the World now acts, in
national Affairs. So that he
supposes, the Persons we send
to Parliament or Assembly, to
represent us as Adam did his
Posterity, that their publick
Acts are our publick Acts, & if
they do amiss, as our
Representatives, that their Sin
must be our Sin, otherwise the
Cases will not be at all parallel.
Now, admitting all the Letter
Writer pleads for that the
Persons we send to Parliament
or Assembly, do so represent
us, as that their publick Acts
are Ours, and whenever they do
amiss, as our Representatives,
their Sin is our Sin; yet will not
any Advantage accrue thereby
to the Doctrine of Original Sin;
because these Representatives
are chosen by ourselves to act
for us. Now I may easily
conceive the Reasonableness of
ascribing the publick Acts of
such Persons, to a whole
Nation or People, as they
themselves chose and
appointed to represent them in
temporal Matters, as supposing
such a Representation might be
very much for their Advantage,
and still not perceive the
Agreeableness of a quite
different Case to the Goodness
of God, namely, that he should
appoint Adam to be the publick
Representative of all his
Posterity, when their eternal
State was concerned without
their Consent, when He knew
that his constituting him such a
publick Representative would
not at all advantage one single
Person, but issue in the certain
Damage of all Mankind; it
making them all come into the
World Children of Wrath, and
Heirs of Hell, and exposing
Millions of innocent Infants, if
they die in that sinless State, to
unavoidable Damnation. So
that we may safely enough
allow such a publick
Representation of Persons, as
the Letter Writer says is the
general Principle upon which
the World now acts, in national
Affairs, and from whence the
Justice of them must, in his
Opinion, emerge; and yet the
Doctrine of Original Sin may
notwithstanding be with Justice
exploded. The Letter Writer, if
he pleased might have put a
more exact Parallel; which
since he has not done, I will do
it for him. Suppose a King
should, by his own arbitrary
Will, resolve that one Person
should be made a publick
Representative of all his
Subjects, so that all his Acts
should be their Acts, and his
Sin should be their Sin, and
they should hold their Lives
and Estates, or forfeit them,
according as he was either
obedient or disobedient to the
Laws; and lastly, if he should
not allow them to choose
whom they would to be their
Representative, but without
their Consent would impose
one on them who he knew
would forfeit all their Lives and
Fortunes would the Letter-
Writer justify such an
unreasonable Procedure? If he
can reconcile this to Wisdom (I
say not Cunning and Craft but
true Wisdom) Justice, and
Goodness, then may he hope
that the Doctrine of Original
Sin will no longer be exploded,
but re enter amongst the
gracious and glorious Doctrines
of the Gospel.
But when the Letter Writer
seems to suppose that the
Persons we send to Parliament,
or Assembly; do so represent us
as that their publick Acts are
our Acts, and that whenever the
do amiss, as our
Representatives, their Sin is our
Sin, this Thing, which he so
easily takes for granted, is
wholly unreasonable. For altho'
the Persons, we send thither,
are authorized by us to act for
us, and in our Behalf, and to
make good and wholesome
Laws, such as may be of
Advantage to their Country:
Yet, if they contrary to the good
Design and Intent of their
Constituents, abuse their
Authority, and make evil and
wicked Laws, such as are
contrary to the Interest, and
subversive of their Country's
Liberty, and such as are highly
disapproved of by the wisest,
and best Persons in the
Community, all Persons of
good Sense will ascribe those
Evil Acts to such Parliament
and Assembly, but acquit the
People. They will say that the
Parliament or Assembly were
wicked, and that the People
were injured and oppressed, but
entirely innocent. The Schism
Bill, which was passed in
Parliament in the latter End of
Queen Anne's Reign, was it by
Act not only of the Parliament
but of the whole English
Nation, even of the Dissenters
themselves? If so they were a
very unreasonable People to
pass such a Bill in the House,
and one of Doors to complain
against what was their own Act
and Deed. The People's
Representatives in Parliament
are not, nor can be esteemed
the whole Body of the People,
there is no such Magic in the
Name and Title of
Representatives as will make
them such; they are a part of
the Legislature rather than of
the People; and tho' they should
be the most friendly part of the
Legislature to the People,
because 'tis to them they owe
their Power, yet 'tis frequently
otherwise, they often do Things
contrary both to the Intent and
Minds of those that created
them, and in such Case, the
People ought not to be charged
with their Crimes. As the
Legislature ought not to bear
the Sins of a rebellious People,
so should not an innocent
People be saddled with the Sins
of the Legislature.
And now I should be very
much obliged to the Letter
Writer, if he would be pleased
to prove, either from Scripture
or Reason, that God entered
into a Covenant with Adam, not
only for himself, but for all his
Posterity, that he standing they
should all stand, and he falling
they should all unavoidably be
exposed to everlasting
Burnings; and show me how
this Hypothesis is reconcileable
to the Perfections of the Deity,
his Wisdom, Justice, and
Goodness; and that the
Supposition, that we are made
Sinners for Adam's
Transgression only, agrees with
these Propositions; No one is a
Sinner for what was done
before he was born. No one is
guilty of Sin for doing what he
could not but do, or for being
what he could not but be. And
lastly, that no one can be guilty
of Sin before he is capable of
knowing or receiving a Law, or
distinguishing Good from Evil;
which are evident Maxims and
first Principles of Reason. If the
Letter Writer will give me an
Answer to this Request; altho'
at present I conceive the
Doctrine of Original Sin to be,
not a Doctrine, above, but
below Reason; not a Doctrine
which I cannot understand, but
which I do comprehend, and
think dishonourable to God,
and unworthy a wise Man to
receive. Yet will I upon a
rational Conviction of my
Mistake, alter my Sentiments,
and love and honour that Man
who shall be instrumental in
my Conversion to Mr.
Whitefield's and the Letter
Writer's Creed and System.

IT was not till last Month that
Thamas Kouli-Kan arrived here
from his Expedition against
Machmet Cach, Emperor of the
Moguls. The Treaty he
concluded with that Prince is
just published. In that Treaty
the Great Mogul gives to
Kouli-Kan the Title of Schach
Nadir, King of Kings, King of
Time, the Refuge of the
Mahometans, Pattern of
Conquerors, Successor and
Imitator of Alexander. The Rest
runs thus.
""The Great Schach Nadir
having sent me an Embassador
to treat about some Affairs, I
did all that lay in my Power to
dispatch him as soon as
possible. The Schach would not
have been obliged to send back
to me Mahomet Kamtour Kan,
had it not been for the
Negligence of my Ministers,
who always delay'd giving an
Answer and retarded the
Embassador, rather chusing to
embroil us and sow Discord
between our two States than do
what I order'd them. This was
the Cause that Schach Nadir,
impatient at not seeing his
Embassador's Return, resolved
to come into my Dominions.
We fought; Victory leaned to
his Side, and Fortune favoured
him so far as to make him
Master of my Empire. He
entered Delly, of which he also
made himself Master; he
secur'd my Person and took all
my Jewels, and moreover
obliged me lay before him an
Estimate of my Revenues. But
Schach Nadir having promised
to set him again upon the
Throne, I declare him lawful
and sovereign Master of all the
Territories lying to the West of
the Country of Noudbeck, the
Sea of Snide, the River
Sangoro, Chaour, the District of
Caboul, the Mountains of
Pattan and Jat, the Fortress of
Yexel, Condabat, and all that
depends on Patta and Tatta,
reserving for myself the whole
Empire of Indostan. This
Cession includes the whole
Country lying between
Candahar and the River Indus.""
(Here they give us an Account
of the Booty made in the Indies
by the Persian Monarch,
whereby it appears that the
whole amounted to
126,036,363l. Sterling.)
The Schach also imposed an
annual Tribute on the Mogul of
75 Millions of Livres, or
3,400,000l. Sterling, and fixed
the Sum of 110 Millions of
Livres for the Support and
Charges of the Mogul Court.
The bad Government of the
Mogul's Empire occasion'd this
sudden Revolution, of which
we have hardly an Example in
History. The People groaned
under the Oppression of the
Grandees. Machmet Chach, a
Prince little better than an
Ideot, and wholly taken up with
his Pleasures, left the
Management of the Empire to
Candorem and Camordikan, his
two Favourites, who minded
nothing but scraping up Riches.
The State was without Troops,
because the Generals charged
to maintain them put the Sams
destin'd for that Use into their
own Pockets. Rebels from the
Coast of Malabar and
Coromandel used to advance in
a Body even into Indostan,
where the little Resistance they
met with shew'd how easy it
would be to invade that
Empire. While Kouli-Kan was
extending his Conquests in it
with an Army of 80,000 Horse
and 20,000 Foot well
disciplin'd and us'd to War,
besides 250 Pieces of Cannon,
Machmet Chach was at Delly,
where he thought himself very
safe, thinking he had done
enough in raising an Army of
200,000 Horse and 500,000
Foot, with 5000 Elephants
equipp'd for Battle, and 8000
Pieces of Cannon; but the
Difference was, that the
Mogul's Army was raised in
Haste, and wanted all sorts of
Necessaries. The Battle of the
22d of February 1739, in which
100,000 Men and Part of the
Emperor's Family lost their
Lives, decided the Fate of that
Prince, and secur'd the Empire
to Kouli Kan, who restor'd it
upon the Conditions above-
mentioned. Kouli Kan, during
his Stay at Delly, coined some
Money in this Name, with this
Inscription: Schach Nadir is
born to be King of the World;
he is the King of Kings. ----
This short History furnishes
Posterity with an indelible
Momento: We see here a fine
Kingdom lost, and the
prodigious Wealth of one of the
most opulent Cities perhaps in
the World, the Effects of Trade
and the Industry of the
Inhabitants, the Property of
innumerable Families, become
an easy Prey to a foreign
Invader, and the Plunder of his
conquering Troops, merely
thro' the Easiness of the Prince
and the Avarice of his
Ministers, whose blundering
Conduct, and Incapacities for
the Reins of Government, were
the principal Motives that
invited the Conqueror to the
Invasions. On the View hereof,
whether Pity for the unhappy
Sufferers, or Indignation at the
Authors of so dreadful
Calamities, should have the
Ascendant in the generous
Breast, we will not say; but
certainly after so remarkable an
Example, that Prince or People,
who shall suffer themselves by
the same Causes to be exposed

Dear SIR,

I Was last Night shock'd with the melancholy News of the South East Part of Charles Town being burnt down on Tuesday How deplorable is the Condition of many there, that are in a few Hours reduc'd to want of Bread! Surely God's just Judgments are upon us __ Is there Evil befallen to a City, and the Lord hath not done it? faith the Prophet. We have been harden'd under the Sun-shine, the bounteous Dispensations of his Providence; and tho' for some Year's past, he hath at divers Times been scourging of us, by Drought; by repeated Diseases on Man and Beast; by Insurrections of our Slaves , and lately by Bassling shamefully our Enterprize against our Enemy, so as to make us a By-Word and an Hissing among the Heathen that are round about us; yet we have not laid it to Heart to turn to HIM As are the People, so are the Priests: Every one seeking after Gain; nourishing their Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter; and few, very few, say within themselves, wherefore hath the Lord done these Things? Or turn to seek unto the Hand that hath smitten us. O! that this fiery Dispensation may now lead us to Repentance, and truly humble us before GOD, that the Fury of his Anger may turn away from us, and that we be not utterly consumed! How ought we every one to mourn and lament over our Iniquities, and the Iniquities of our Province and Nation; and lift up our Hearts with our Hands to God in the Heavens, with continual Intercessions for ourselves and People, that he may give us true Faith and Repentance; forgive all our Iniquities, and incline our Hearts to be intirely devoted to keep his Laws, and to glorify his Holy Name; that He may incline, rule and direct the Hearts of our King and all in Authority, so that they may faithfully and duly execute Justice, and maintain true Religion and Godliness; and that He may inspire all Ministers of his holy Word and Ordinances with heavenly Wisdom and Grace, that they may understand his Will and faithfully teach, exhort and reprove, both by Example and Precept, in much Love and Lowliness of Mind. O how great will their Judgment be who do the Work of the Lord negligently, and speak leasingly, and cry Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace, deceiving precious Souls and causing them to sleep in their Sins to Damnation. Many, too many such are crept into Christ's visible Church, for whom we may justly take up Jermiah's Lamentation, and say, The Prophets have seen vain and foolish Things for thee, and they have not discover'd unto thee thine Iniquity, Lam ii 14. Many indeed in our Day have seen vain and follish Things; their Hearts have run after their Covetousness, and they have delighted themselves in the foolish and and vain Enjoyment of worldly Goods and Pleasures, nourishing and indulging themselves in the same Passions, Tempers and Delights with other Worldly minded Men, and by their Practices have made the Commandments and Doctrines of the blessed JESUS (their pretended Master) as much as in them lay of none Effect; for they entice the People to follow their Example, and depart from God: Thus do they pretendedly take upon them a Commission from the Lord of Hosts to fight the Devil's Battles, and, Judas- like, betray our Lord and Master with pretended Kisses of Friendship. ____ O! how sore will the Punishment of such negligent Watchmen be! Ezek. Xxxiii. 6 But if the Watchman see the Sword come, and blow not the Trumpet, and the People be not warned; if the Sword come and take any Person from among them, he is taken away in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at the Watchman's Hand, faith the LORD Who there sheweth EZEKIEL his Duty from the 7th Verse, saying, So thou, O Son of Man, I have set thee a Watchman unto the House of Israel: Therefore thou shalt hear the Word at my Mouth and warn them from me. __ When I say unto the Wicked, O wicked Man, thou shalf surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the Wicked from his Way, that wicked Man shall die in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at thine Hand.___ See JER. xxiii I EZEK. Xxxiv 2d to the 10th We be to the Shepherds or Pastors that scatter the Sheep; that feed themselves, and do not feed the Sheep And JER. xxiii 21. I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran, faith the LORD; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. And again, Verse 30. I am against the Prophets that steal my Word every man from his Neighbour, faith the LORD: These all serve for Gain They are Thieves and Robbers who come not in by the Door of the Sheep sold, but climb up the Wall by carnal Helps, and get in, to prey on the Sheep; neither follow the Foot-steps of our true Shepherd, but covet the Fleece only How many poor careless Souls have we in every Parish that stand in Need of being informed of their Danger, and of the absolute Necessity of being born again of GOD, and having CHRIST's personal Righteousness imputed to them, before they can have any well-grounded Hope of being finally saved! How many within a few Miles of their Teachers die in their Sins, without being warned or exhorted to come to CHRIST by Faith! The Blood of such will be required at their Teacher's Hands. O! how becoming the Office of Ambassadors of JESUS CHRIST would it be, to go forth to every Soul (of their Parishioners at least) and make Offers of Peace, and invite them to come in on Gospel Terms? Can any love love their Master with all their Souls and Strength? Can they love the Flock as he loved it, and not seek diligently the Wellfare of every Sheep committed to their Charge? Are immortal Souls of less Value now than in the Days of our Saviour and his Apostles, that the same Concern shou'd not now be shewn for their eternal Wellfare as was then? Can they deal faithfully with their master, and not stand in the Gap to deliver unwary Souls from the Jaws of the Lion? This is just as consistent with their high Calling, as for any one to stand by and see a Man deliberately murder himself, and not persuade him from his Rashness.

Shall our Clergy at this Day shew a furious Zeal about the Decrees and Cannons of the Church, even so as to persecute Christ's faithful Ministers for not conforming exactly to these Appendages of Religion (tho' they themselves break these Cannons every Day) and have no Bowels of Love, no Pity for poor perishing Souls, that are wandring in worse than AEgyptain Darkness? Is not this to tythe Mint and Cummin, and neglect Mercy and Judgment? OShame! Shame! Is this to imitate their Master, who went about doing Good? Is this like St. Paul's Practice, who not only taught publickly, but from House to House? Surely the God of this World hath blinded the Eyes of such false Prophets O how will their Mammon of Unrighteousness eat them as doth Fire, at the glorious Appearance of our Lord, when he shall call them to an Account! I doubt not but the Devil triumphs in beholding these Shepherds at the Head of their Flocks, following him down to the Regions of Darkness for Mammon Be astonish'd, O Heavens! Mourn, O Earth! because the Deceiver is come forth amongst us with great Power, seducing both Pastors and People, to deal falsly with the great GOD of Heaven and Earth; to despise his Mercies, his Chastisements, his Authority, and even the Son of his Love, whom they they by wicked Hands crucify daily, for the Wages of Unrighteousness. The LORD hath sworn by the Excellency of Jacob, surely I will never forget any of their Works, Amos viii. 7. And will he not deal with the Inhabitants of this Province as with the Obstinate of Judah, who like unto us despised Mercies and Chastisements. See Jer xxiv. 9. 10. And I will deliver them to be removed, & c. for their Hurt, to be a Reproach and a Proverb, a Taunt and a Curse in all Places whether I shall drive them. I will send the Sword, the Famine, and the Pestilence among them, 'till they be consumed from off the Land that I gave unto them and to their Fathers. Shall not our Land mourn for this, and every one that dwelleth therein? Jer. iv. 28. O! that they wou'd Hear and give Ear, and not be proud, for the LORD hath spoken. Jer. xiii. 15. His Drought hath spoken; His Diseases inflicted on us and our Cattle have spoken; the Insurrections of our Slaves have spoken; our Augustine Expedition hath spoken; the Faithful of CHRIST's Ministers have lately, in a remarkable Manner, been speaking; and the yet later dreadful Fire of Charles-Town hath spoken Terror: And if we regard not this to lay it to Heart, humble ourselves, and repent truly of our Sins; the just GOD will yet pour out upon us more terrible Vials of his Wrath. If only at a Hand Writing of God on the Wall, which the great Belshazzer understood not, his Countenance was changed, his Thoughts troubled, the Joints of his Loins loosed. and his Knees [ ] one against another thro' Fear; shou'd we not much more tremble, whose Crimes are against the clear Light of eternal Truth, and not only see but feel GOD's Hand upon us. - - O! that our KING wou'd humble himself, lest his Principalities shou'd come down, even the Crown of his Glory; for GOD regardeth nt Princes, except their Thrones are established in Righteousness. O! that all in Authority under him, in the Civil Powers amongst us throughout his Dominions, would humble themselves, and duly consider, that the great GOD, by whom they enjoy any Power, will strictly require at their Hands a due and conscientious Improvement of the Talents committed to their Trust. And O! that all who stile themselves Ambassadors of Jesus Christ, wou'd humble themselves; and consider well their Mission, who sent them, and the Importance of the Errand on which they are sent. And O! that our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who opened our Eyes of the Blind and raised to the Dead to Life, would be graciously pleased to pen all our Eyes, to see and know clearly, his eternal Truths declared to us in his holy Scriptures, which only are able to make us wise unto Salvation! May He raise and quicken our filthy, sinful, sluggish Hearts, from their Lethargy of sensual Delights, to seek that Pearl of great Price his everlasting Righteousness, and a Union of Spirits with Himself, which only is able to give us true Joy, the full Assurance of his Favour here, and of eternal Blessedness when Time shall be no more.",blackUnrest

began to be suspected. To come
at the Truth, a resolution was
taken to arrest some of them,
who were strictly examin'd
Their prevaricating Answers
confirm'd the Suspicions
already entretain'd. Several
other Persons, who seem'd to

Four of them confess'd at last

Two Negroes were burnt here,

they were guilty of the Crimes,

and in part carried into

have learned, that this most
horrible and wicked
Conspiracy has been a long
Time in Agitation, and almost
generally among the Negroes,
John Huson (executed last
Week, with his Wife and
Margaret Kerry) was a
Contriver and grand Promoter
of this detestable Scene of
Villainy, which was calculated,
not only to ruin and destroy this
City, but the whole Province,
and it appears that to effect this
their Design was first to burn
the Fort, and if Opportunity
favoured to seize and carry
away the Arms in store there,
them to burn the whole Town,
and kill and murder all the
Male Inhabitants thereof (the
Females they intended to
reserve for their own Use) and
this to be effected by seizing
their Master's Arms and a
general Rising, it appears also
as we are informed that these
Designs were not only carried
on in this City, but had also
spread into the Country, and
that the Spanish Negroes (of
which there are many in this
Place) were deeply concerned
and active in the Business; and
what ever Encouragement or
Assurances they might receive
from Abroad, or hellish
Incendiaries at Home, they
were persuaded that an Attempt
on this Province would be
made by the Spaniards and
French, for whom they agreed
to wait some Time; and if it
should happen that such an
Attempt should be made, and
our Enemies invade us, they
were to rise and join with them.
Huson having bought and
procured Arms, Ammunition
and Powder for that Purpose;
and if such an Invasion should
not happen, they were to carry
their diabolical Scheme into
Execution themselves. And so
far had they gone that the
particular Places to be burnt
were laid out, their Captains
and other Officers appointed,
and that places of general
Rendezvous fixed, and the
Number of Negroes concern'd
is almost incredible, and their
barbarous Designs still more
so, especially when it is
considered that white People
were privy to and Fomenters of
so unparallel'd a Villainy,
which was by keeping their
Invention so privately laid, and
the concerned so artfully bound
by the most horrid and
execrable Oaths, that in all

remained a Secret till they had
done more Mischief, but by the

said Ambassador, to inform
their High Mightinesses,
""That the States of the
Russias, the Senate, the
Synod, and the other
principal Orders, could bear
no longer to let the Supreme
Authority remain in the
Hands of those, who, by a
long Series of Acts of
Violence, one after another,
had usurp'd it ever since the
Death of the Emperor Peter I.

Prince had committed the
Execution of his last Will, not
having perform'd it: That in
order to put a Stop to these
Usurpations, and to restore
the Crown to the Lawful Heir
they had unanimously
declar'd the Princess
Elizabeth, Daughter of the
said Emperor, to be their
Sovereign, Sole Monarch, and
Empress: And that her
Imperial Majesty at the same

Assurances, that she would
not fail to cultivate that
perfect good Understanding
with this State, which has
subsisted between her
Predecessors and this
Republick; and upon all
Occasions to give it Proofs of
her Affection.""
This Order was sign'd
ELIZABETH.
In pursuance hereof the
Count Goloskin went the
same Night to the Pensionary
Vander Hein, and then to the
Gressier Fagel, to notify the
same to both those Ministers.
His Excellency has received
no other News or Letter
whatsoever, so that we know
not what Changes have been
made in the Ministry, nor
indeed any one Thing that
has been transacted in this
Revolution. All that is given
out is, that the Prince
Nariskin, who is in a sort of
Exile, and now at Paris, will
shortly return to
Petersbourgh; and 'tis
thought the new Empress will
soon declare her Marriage.
Mean time 'tis conjectur'd,
that this Revolution, and the
Resolution the King of
Sardinia has now taken in
favour of the King of Spain
will hasten a general Peace.
In the Count de Goloskin's
Packet came the following
Piece, viz.
The Manifesto of the
Empress Elisabeth, Sovereign
of all the Russia's.
""We Elizabeth I. Empress

Consequence of the Letters
Parents issued the 16th of
October, 1740, the late Grand
Lady Empress Anne
Joannowna appointed, before

not only refuses to treat
with Sweden, by the
Mediation of France, but
told the Marquis de la
Chetardie, the French
Ambassador, that the
Mediation of his Court
was neither necessary
nor proper, nor desired.
Nor can it be wondered that
this Answer was given him, if
what is related is true, that a
Conspiracy had been
discovered, which had been
formed by him against the
Czarina, for which 100
Persons have been seized.
However, Sweden appears
now more desirous of Peace
than to prosecute War, a
favourable Reception has
been given to the new
Proposals which she has
made. The Swedish Garrison
at Fredericksham, after
setting Fire, having left it in
Flames, the Russian Hussars
entered the Town on the 19th
Instant, and extinguished
them.
Price Charles of Lorrain has
his Head Quarters at
Konigshal, nor far from
Prague, and having received
his heavy Artillery and a
Reinforcement from Moravia
of 16000 Men, under General
Festituz, is preparing to
attack the French Troops,
which the Loss of 6000 in
their late precipitate Retreat,
has reduced, notwithstanding
their late Supplies, to 15000
Men, who altogether with the
Garrison, are reduced to
great Distress, having been
obliged to kill their Horses
for Food. Marshal Broglio
has forbidden the Burghers
of Prague to go out of the
City under Pain of Death,
and caused Piles of Faggots to
be raised in the Streets, in
orded to set Fire to them in
Case they make the least
Resistance. In this Miserable
Condition Broglio sent
positive Orders to the Duke
d'Harcourt in Bavaria, to
march immediately into
Bohemia with all his Forces.
But as such a precipitate
March, with Count
Khevenhuller at his Rear,
must inevitably ruin the
Army; and as he could only
join Broglio by defeating the
Austrians, he resolved to
continue where he was. Their
next Recourse was to
Negotiation, in which
Marshal Belle-Isle offered
Felt Marshal Konigsegg, to
deliver up Prague to the
Austrians, provided the
French Garrison were
allowed to march out with
their Arms, Baggage, and all
the Honours of War, and to
join the rest of the Army,
which would immediately
evacuate Bohemia. But
Konigsegg insisted that the
Garrison should surrender
Prisoners of War. Since
Prince Charles of Lorrain has
received his Artillery and
Reinforcements, he has
absolutely refused any
Capitulation either to the
Garrison or to the Army.
It appears now that the
French Army is left alone to
withstand the Fury of the
exasperated Austrians. For
the King of Prussia having
had a Copy of Marshal
Broglio's Dispatches of the
fourth of May sent to him,
the Treachery of France was
visible enough, but his
Majesty did not think it
possible. Those Dispatches
inform'd Marshal Broglio of
a Reinforcement of 5000 Men
sending him by his Court.
They likewise contain'd
Instructions for regulating
the Conduct of that General,
and of the Use he was to
make of his Forces. By the 1st
Instruction the Court
expressly forbids him to mix
his Troops with those of his
Prussian Majesty. The 2d
directs him to spare his Army
as much as he could, and to
act always in a different
Quarter from the Prussians.
The 3d orders him to always
preserve a Body of 20 or
25000 of the best Troops in
order to cover and observe
the Prussian Army, as well in
a Siege, as in a general
Action. By the 4th, he is
directed to employ his Body
in closely examining into the
Conduct of that Prince, and
the Steps and Motions of his
Army, for Causes and
Reasons of great Importance.
By the 5th he is order'd to
hazard nothing, under
Pretence that neither the
French Reinforcement was
yet arrived at the Army, nor
the Marshal de Belle-Isle,
who only had Orders from
his Most Christian Majesty to
command with the King of
Prussia.
His Prussian Majesty at that
Time gave no Heed to these
salutary Warnings, beleiving
them to come from the
Enemy's Quarter; and
instead of withdrawing from
his Camp, as he ought to have
done, on the Contrary he
gave Prince d'Anhalt Orders
to hasten his March, in order
to join him in his Came of
Czaslaw; where Marshal
Broglio was, according to his
Promise, to come with his
army in two Days, but who
never came.
The King of Prussia having
four Days after been alone
obliged to sustain the Battle
of Czaslaw, at which he lost
13000 effective Men, he
discover'd, tho' too late, that
France was deceiving him,
and that his Army was
certainly to be sacrificed.
The Inhabitants of the
Dutchy of Cleves being
apprehensive of the French,
the King of Prussia is
forming there a Body of
30,000 Men, for their
Protection, that Monarch
does not omit to cultivate the
Commerce of his new
Subjects in Silesia, having
settled two great Fairs, which
he ordered to be published in
the London Gazette for the
Merchants of Great Britain to
frequent them.
The Preliminary Articles of
Peace are settled between
their Hungarian and Polish
Majesties; whereby the
Queen of Hungary cedes to
the King of Poland some
Districts in Bohemia, and the
King guarantees to the Queen
the rest of Bohemia, and all
her other Dominions,
promises to accede to the
Treaty of Breslaw, within a
certain Term, and engages to
assist her with 22,000 Men
when required. The Saxen
Troops has retired from
Bohemia the 28th past.
Her Hungarian Majesty in
her Letters to her Ministers
at foreign Courts to acqaint
them with the Treaty of
Breslaw, expresses herself in
this Manner, ""I only
consented to this Peace and to
the Sacrifice which I made of
Silesia, for the good of the
Empire, and to be in a
Condition so to drive out its
Enemies and mine. I flatter
myself the Empire will
acknowledge this Sacrifice in
a proper Manner, and assist
me with all its Forces to
procure me an Equivalent for
the Loss I have sustain'd, and
counterbalance the Prejudice
which the Equilibrium might
suffer from it.""
The Emperor has received
little Satisfaction from the
Diet of the Empire at
Frankfort. Every Prince and
Circle have some Grievance
to complain of, of which the
Redress is expected before
any Aid is granted to his
Majesty. It is particularly
required by them, that their
Territories be freed from the
French Troops, and that the
Inhabitants be indemnified
from the Damage which they
have sustain'd by them.
The French have resolved to
raise 50000 Militia, of which
Part is to assist the Count de
Glimes, Commander of the
Spanish Troops in Provence,
who have received express
Orders to penetrate tho'
Piemont into Italy.
The Citaded of Moderna
having surrendered, and the
Garrison of 3000 Men made
Prisoners on the 14th past,
will with the City belong
henceforth to the King of
Sardinia; and Mirandola
which surrendered the 11th
Instant, to the Queen of
Hungary.

Republick, in order to reduce
the Kingdom of Corsica to the
Obedience of its lawful
Sovereigns; but after the
Departure of these Troops,
the Rebellion having broke
out again, his most Christian
Majesty was pleased to offer
to bring back the Corsicans to
their Duty and restore the
Tranquility of the Island.
The Republick
communicated that Treaty to
your Majesty, and beseech'd
you to enter into
Engagements so just, by
granting her the Guaranty to
Corsica, in the Same [ ] as
had been done in Concert by
the late Emperor and his
most Christian Majesty.
Tho' your Majesty did not
think fit at that Juncture to
secure to that Treaty, yet you
were to good as to make
Answer to the Republick's
Minister, that you were
pleased with is Mark of her
Regard and Attention; that
you look's upon the Succours
offer'd by Frances as the best
and only Means to put an
End to the Rebellion; that the
Republick might be assured
of your Majesty's favourable
Intentions, who had given her
Proof thereof before any
other Prince did, in expressly
forbidding all Officers of
Ships under English Colours
to transport to Corsica Arms
& warlike Stores, or to hold
any Manner of
Correspondence with the
Rebels.
After such signal Proofs of
your Majesty's Regard for
the Republick, and there
Recent Assurances thereof
which she has received on
Account of what was lately
done by Vice-Admiral
Mathew's Squadron we have
Advices from divers Pars that
Theodore de Neuhoff, known
in the World to be the Author
of the Troubles in Corsica,
was in the British Seas, and
intended to set sail for the
Mediterranean. We have
since learn'd that he appear'd
on the Coast of Portugal on
board an English Man of War
commanded by Capitan
George Barclay; and that it
was currently reported at
Lizbon, that he was going to
Corsica with Arms and
Ammunition.
Afterwards we had Advice
that he touch'd at Villa-
Franca, in the said Ship, and
at last, that he put into
Leghorn, about the Middle of
February: That he receiv'd
there on board his Ship
several of the Principal of the
[ ] and seditious Chiefs of the
Corsicans, who had been
dispers'd in several Towns in
Tuscany: That he had a
private Conference of several
Hours with General
Breitewitz, who came from
Florence to Leghorn, and
went on board the English
Ship in Company with the
British Consul. In fine, we
heard that the said Theodore
departed from there with
those Chiefs of the Rebels, all
embark'd in the same Ship, in
the Night of the 30th of last
January, steering towards
Corsica, in Company with
another English Man of War
called the Salisbury,
commanded by Capt. Peter
Osborn That a few Days
before, the said Theodore had
dispatch'd an [ ] to Corsica,
one Vincess by Name, in
another English Man of War,
and had caused a seditious
Edict to be dispatch'd, dated
the 7th Year of his Reign; in
which Edict he discovers his
Views and Intentions against
the Tranquility of Corsica,
even in Expressions so
unguarded as the Powers of
Europe might justly be
offended at.
The Republick has received
further Intelligence from her
Commissary General and
Commandants of the Towns
in Corsica, viz. That the
above mentioned Emissary of
Theodore had landed in the
Island; that he was spiriting
up the People to a new
Rebellion; that he promis'd
them the Arrival of Theodore,
with several English Men of
War, Land Forces, and a
great Quantity of Arms and
Ammunition. The said
Commissary General and
Commandants also write,
that the Revenge and the
Sainbury had appear'd on the
Coast of Corsica, and landed
Gun powder and other
warlike Stores at a Place
call'd Isola Ressa; that these
Ships cruized in that Sea in
order to intercept, as 'tis said,
the Succours that might be
sent from Genoa, to the
Places in the Island; and that
in the mean Time they
actually stopped, with their
Long Beats, all the casting
small Craft under Gencese
Colours, taking out their
Cargoes, and detaining the
Sailors on board their Vessels
some Time; that Theodore,
being still in the Revenge, had
summoned the commanding
Officers, of some little Forts,
to surrender, otherwise, they
should be treated with the
utmost Severity of War.
The Republick being
persuaded of your Majesty's
magnanimous Sentiments,
and of the Wisdom of your
Ministry, who are a Pattern
to other Nations in regard to
Equity and Justice, the most
constant Maxim of which has
always been, That all Princes
be maintain'd in their Rights
and Dominions; the
Republick, I say, cannot
express the Surprize and
Confusion which so positive
and circumstances Accounts
have caused her: She cannot
form any Conjecture well
enough grouded about the
Cause of so unforeseen an
Event. She cannot imagine
that the Commanders and
Captains of the English Ships
can, in their own Names, and
thro' selfish Views, be guilty
of such Attempts. Besides she
is very well assured, that if
false Reports could have
prejudicted your Majesty,
you would not have fail'd to
communicate your
Sentiments to the Republick's
Minster, [ ] the End that she
might justify herself in a
proper Manner, until your
Majesty was thoroughly
satisfied.
I am charg'd, by Orders of
my Republick, which have
been dispatch'd to me by an
Express, to represent most
humbly to your Majesty all
the above Things, and at the
same Time to beseech you to
cause the necessary Ecclair-
cisements to be given to the
Republick, to the End that in
her Anxiety, as well as in the
Steps she may take, she may
Behave so as to deserve the
just Approbation of the
British Crown.

CONSTANTINOPLE.
THE restless Ambition of the
Persian Monarch, or perhaps
the Necessity of engaging his
Forces in foreign Expeditions,
to prevent Mutinies and
Rebellions, has drawn his
Arms upon the Ottoman

Notion of their Surperiority
to all other Powers, have
ordered an Army to be levied,
and have erected the Horse

their Loss caused an
Insurrection, in which the

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Elizabeth Timothy,1744_02_27,"February 27, 1744",1744,"A full Discovery of the
Conspiracy has now
been made, by which it
appears that many
Persons of high [ ] were
engaged in it, and then
their Design was no less
than to produce a new
Revolution.
The [ ] Conspirator of both [ ]
who . . . to be . . . the Judges .

the Czarina obtained a
Remission of their Sentence,
but have however been
punished in such a Manner as
cannot be read in politer
Countries without Horror.
They suffered the [ ], a Kind
of cruel Bastinado on a
publick Scaffold, their
Tongues were then cut out,
and they were dispatched to
Siberia to spend the
remaining Part of their Lives
among the Savages.
It might produce a very
curious Speculation, to
enquire whether Severity
procures any Security to a
Government. At the first
View it appears, that the Fear
which it produces most
naturally discourage
Conspiracies, but that the
same Motive, when they are
once formed, will excite a
Kind of desperate Resolution,
since there is no medium
between Success and
insupportable Misery.
Of this Conspiracy the most
remarkable Circumstance is
the Conduct of the Marquis
de Botta, Minister of the
Queen of Hungary at
Petersburgh, who is said to
have fomented the Malice of
these Malecontents, and
promote their Design by
promising them Assistance
from Prussia. This is a
Transaction that must be
explained by future
Discoveries, and the
Information which the
Account ordered by the
Czarina to be publish'd will
afford us. The Queen of
Hungary disowns any secret
Connivance of the Conduct of
her Minister, and promises
that, if the Crime charged
upon him can be proved, he
shall suffer the Punishment,
which he appears to deserve
for having injured at once the
Sovereign by whom he was
employed, and at whose
Court he resided. It is indeed
not likely, that the Queen of
Hungary should, after the
Treaties that have been made,
desire a new Resolution in
Russia; but if we judge only
of Motives of Interest, it was
natural for the King of
Prussia to wish himself set
free from the Fears which an
Union of Russia and the
House of Austria must excite
in him, and it must be
confessed an uncommon
Stroke of Policy to employ the
Austrian Minister in the
Conspiracy, that he might
expect to see the Union
broken whether it shou'd
succeed or fail.
As we are now indulging
Conjectures which we do not
pretend wholly to justify, we
will venture to hint that it
may perhaps be shown at a
convenient Distance of Time,
that this Conspiracy was
contrived and discovered by
the same Persons who
brought the Czarina into
Danger, that they might have
the Merit of delivering her,
and corrupted the Austrian
Minister, that they might
injure . . .
It is observable that France
has thought this a very
favourable Opportunity of
regaining her Influence, and
has proposed a new Treaty
with the Czarina, and offered
to assist her against the
Designs of her Enemies,
among whom the Queen of
Hungary is undoubtedly
numbered.
But while these and a
thousand other Suppesitions
of the same Kind are formed,
it is not impossible that Botta
may be innocent, or that the
utmost of his Crime was want
of Prudence.
The Armament which
has been fomented with
so much Diligence and at
so great an Expence, is
now no longer expected
to be employed, and the
Ammunition is therefore
to be again reposited in
the Magazines, and the
Soldiers to be dispersed
into their usual
Quarters.
It is believed not without
Reason, that the Discovery of
the Russian Conspiracy has
had a very extensive
influence; and the sudden
Alteration of the Danish
Measures, without any other
apparent Reason may give
Suspicion that the Invasion of
Sweden was projected in
Confidence that the
Assistance of Russia would be
withdrawn. There are new
schemes of Accomodation
produced, and Exchanges of
Dominion mentioned, nor
does there remain any
Appearance of a Design to
engage in the Hazard of a
War.",nonslave
The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Elizabeth Timothy,1744_03_05,"March  5, 1744",1744,"Though the French have
been hitherto
disappointed in their
Designs of reducing the
Power of the House of

to suspect, that they
have not so much
wanted Strength for
more vigorous
Measures, as reserved it

amore favourable
Opportunity.
Had the Conspiracy disunited
Russia from the House of
Austria, the Confederacy
would have been very much
weakened and a single Battle
might have restored France
to its former Power. The
Conspiracy is discovered and
they are now endeavouring to
take Advantage of the
discovery, but it may be
reasonably hoped that they
have made their Designs and
their Maxims too publick to
obtain any Credit. As the
Approach of Winter puts a

To GEORGE the Second,
King of Great Britain, &c.
The humble ADDRESS of his
Protestant Subjects, the
People called QUAKERS.
May it please the King,
WE thy faithful and
peaceable Subjects, being
deeply concerned for the
Safety and Preservation of
thy Person, Family and
Government, beg Leave to
approach thy Throne, to
declare our Abhorrence and
Detestation of all Plots and
Conspiracies, for the
Subversion of our Religion,
Laws and Liberties, and the
introducing Popery and
arbitrary Power; and of all
Attempts whatsoever to
disturb the Tranquility of
these thy Kingdoms; and to
Assure thee, that we are
determined, by the Assistance
of Almighty God, in our
respective Stations,
steadfastly to continue thy
loyal Subjects, and, agreeable
to our known Principles to
contribute all in our Power
for the Preservation of the
publick Peace.
Duty and Affection oblige us
to express our grateful
Acknowledgements for those
inestimable Blessings, our
Religious and Civil Liberties,
which we enjoy under thy
mild and auspicious
Administration.
May the Almighty be pleased
to direct thy Councils by his
Wisdom, and make thee, O
King, the happy Instrument
to calm and compose the
present Differences of Europe
and the glorious Means of re-
establishing Peace and
Tranquility; may his Divine
Providence, who hath
preserved thee in imminent
Dangers, protect thee against
all thine Enemies, make thy
Reign over us long and
prosperous, and continue a
Succession of thy Royal Off
spring, the Blessings of a free
and happy People, to late
Posterity.
Signed in Behalf of the said
People, London,
the 9th Day of the first Month
called March, 1743.
To which His Majesty was
pleased to return this most
gracious Answer.
I THANK you for the very
dutiful and loyal Address.

my constant Protection.",nonslave
The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Elizabeth Timothy,1744_08_20,"August 20, 1744",1744,"The following is an
Account of some
Circumstances relating
to the Enterprize
projected against Great
Britain, given by a
foreign Minister at
Versailles.
A LITTLE Time after the
Death of Cardinal Fleury, the
Court of France sent a Plan
of the Expedition to be made
upon England, to Madrid.
The Queen of Spain, who had
been long distrustful of every
Thing that came from the
Cardinal Fleury, and looked
upon all his Schemes as laid
to ensnare Spain, began the
rather to relish the
Proposition of the Court of
Versailles, as Cardinal Fleury
was now no more, which
Disposition the Bishop of
Rennes, Ambassador from
France at Madrid, took Care
to cultivate, and represented
how greatly this Project
would tend to advance the
Interest of the Crown of
Spain. He said amongst other
Things, that Ireland and
Scotland were ripe for a
Revolt; in short, that there
was in both those Kingdoms,
as well as in England itself, so
general a Discontent, that
there was no Doubt but that
the whole Expeditionwould
be made without any Effusion
of Blood. He added, That it
was the real Intention of his
Most Christian Majesty, as
soon as Things were settled in
England, to fix Don Phillip in
the Kingdom of Ireland, and
to crown him King thereof;
but that it would be
indispensably necessary,
previously to enter into a
Convention in Favour of the
young Pretender, without
stipulating any Thing in
Respect to Ireland, for Fear
of giving Umbrage to the Well
affected, andof making
Enemies.
Whether the eldest Son of the
Pretender has been brought
up in theReligion of the
Church of England, as the
Emissaries of Francetake all
Opportunities of saying he
has, in order to strengthen his
Party, or whether he really
professes the Roman
Catholick Religion, as every
Body is well assur'd he does,
it is very certain, that France,
Spain, and the Emperor did,
in the Month of November
last, enter into a secret
Convention, in order to
procure the Crown of
England for the Son of the
Chevalier de St. George; and
that it was therein stipulated,
that France should supply
him with a Body of 25,000
Men which should be
supported by Twenty Men of
War, in order to attempt an
Invasion, under Pretence that
he was call'd to that Crown
by the English Nation: That
as soon as the Troops were
landed in England, the
Courts of France and Spain
would spread a Manifesto in
that Country, in order to
justify this Step, wherein, in
order to satisfy the English
upon the Point of Religion,
they set forth, that the Person
they proposed to them, was a
Descendant from the House
of Steuart, had been educated
in the Religion of their
Country, and who had the
better Title to the British
Crown, as he was Nephew of
Queen Mary (Consort of
King William) and Queen
Anne, Daughters of the King
James II, his Grandfather.
It was further agreed between
the Two Crowns, that for Ten
Years to come, in Case of
Necessity, France on her Side
shall maintain 30,000 of her
Troops in Great-Britain, and
Spain 10,000, in order to
protect and establish the new
King in his Government, and
prevent Factions from
causing Insurrections within
the Kingdom, and to defend it
from any Surprize from
without. Asit was proper to
acquire the Esteem of the
English Nation, Orders were
sent to the Commanderof the
Brest Squadron that to
interrupt their Trade and
Navigation, but to receive
them aboard as Friends and
Allies. He was likewise
forbidden to attack the
English Fleet, and to remain
upon the defensive in Case of
being attacked. By this
Convention France and the
Emperor lay themselves
under certain Obligation to
Spain, in respect tothe
Austrian Low Countries.",nonslave
The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Elizabeth Timothy,1744_09_10,"September 10, 1744",1744,"April 23. There are private
Letters in Town from Naples,
which say, that a Rebellion is
actually broke out in that
Kingdom; that two Princes
were at the Head of it, who
had rais'd 5000 Men, and
declar'd for the Queen of
Hungary; That these Troops
encreasing daily, had thrown
the Court into the utmost
Consternation, and that a
Revolution was expected",nonslave
The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Elizabeth Timothy,1744_12_17,"December 17, 1744",1744,"THE Throne of France
has even been shaken by
the Thunder Clap which
still rumbles over the
Head of the Marquis De
La Chetardie. The
Consternation is actually
so great at the French
Court upon what has
happen'd in Russia, and
so little can it bear to
have its Transactions
therein scrutinized into;
that those who but
discourse upon this
Subject have Occasion
to make Use or great
Circumspection, for
Fear of being directly
dragged to the Bastille,
which was the Face of
Two Persons of
Distinction the last
Week.
This Affair has taken a Turn
the more perplexing to the
Court of France and his most
Christian Majesty cannot
justify La Chetardie, without
openly breaking with the
Court of Russia, or
sacrificing the principal
Members of his Council, nor
can he prosecute him without
disavowing and treating with
Resentment every thing that
Cardinal Tencin and his
favourite Ministers had
contriv'd against Russia. At
first this Affair was laughed
at, and made a Joke at
Versailles and Paris; but
Cardinal Tencin and the
Count De St. Fierentin having
received private Advice, and
such as were very
disagreeable from Moscow,
upon what had happened
there subsequent to the
Banishment of La Chetardie,
there was no longer Room to
be merry upon it.
These Advices say, among
other things, that
immediately after the Order
of the Empress had been
signified to La Chetardie, his
Pockets were searched, and
he was treated like the lowest
Criminal; that his Cloaths
and every Thing that
belonged to him had been
seized upon; that indeed some
Part of his Effects was
restored to him, with a
promise that his Papers and
every Thing that he left
behind should be punctually
sent after him into France;
but that there had been found
amongst his Papers several
Letters from Cardinal
Tencin, M. Amelot, and
several of the French
Ministry, all sending to
forward the Conspiracy
against the Russian
Government, and to occasion
an Insurrection in that
Empire; besides there were
found a great Number of
scurrilous and indecent
Pieces, at which the Senate
was so enrag'd, as well as at
what had been generally
discovered, that it intirely
took upon itself the
Cognizance of this Affair, and
several moved to have La
Chetardie arrested upon the
Frontiers. Though it has been
very much the great Talent of
France, to extricate herself by
her subtle Address out of
Difficulties, yet it now seems
as if she was thoroughly
embarrassed to get clear of
these shameful Transactions.
In order to complete the
Misfortunes of this intriguing
Court, and its ill Luck would
have it, the King of Prussia,
some of his Ministers, and
particularly the Envoy of
Prussia at Moscow, are
frequently mentioned in La
Chetardie's Papers, at which
this Prince is very much
piqued, and disgusted to such
a Degree, as to have wrote a
very serious Letter thereupon
to Lewis the XVth. People are
seldom displeased or asham'd
to have a Share in successful
and lucrative Projects, tho'
founded upon ever so unjust
Principles; but if they
miscarry, it is highly criminal
ever to say they know any
Thing of the Matter. In short,
this whole Affair in such
Manner perplexes the Court
of France and the Cardinal,
that not knowing what else to
do, they have ordered the
Lieutenant de Police to
impose Silence upon
Babblers, by sending them to
Prison without Distinction.",nonslave

THERE is a Report spread
here, as if Things were in the
utmost Confusion in the
Turkish Empire. A Person of
Distinction at Constantinople
assures us, that there is season
a Day passes without Mutinies
and Insurrections; sometimes
as the very Gates of the
Seraglio. This says he, our most
able Politicians ascribe to the
want of Union among our
Ministers, and the intemperate
Debates in the Divan. There
are, in short, two Parties in the
Council; on for carrying on the,
War vigorously against the
Persians, and the other for
turning the Arms of the
Ottoman Porte against the
Christian. The Ministry are the
Head of the First; and the
Bashaw Ofmin, heretofore
Count Bonneval, is the chief
Support of the other, They are
in a great Measure balanced, so
that it is not easy to determine
which Side will prevail. A few
Days ago Orders were given to
assemble 200,000 Men to be
sent into Asia; but since, a
Resolution has been taken to
send thither 80,000 only, and to
accept of Money from the rest
that were to be empoly'd in the
Expedition. It has been
proposed to demanded of the
Court of Vienna, a Cession of
part of the Country on the
Drave, as belonging to the
Porte by the last Treaty of
Peace. However, after high
Debates, it was agreed to
proceed no farther than to
demand that Commissaries
should be appointed by the
Hungarians, to settle Limits of
our Frontiers ion that Side. But
the Design of forming a great
Camp in the Neighborhood of
Choczim, will certainly take
Place; which is the Reason that
the Inhabitants of Turkish
Wallachia are withdrawing and
carrying off the best of their
Effects. All our Advices from

When the pretended Prince of
Wales landed in Scotland, he
had a Rennue of 25 Persons,
among whom were the Marquis
of Tullibardine, Mr. Kelly,
(who was concern'd with the
Bishop of Rochester, and some
years ago escap'd out of the
Tower of London after he had
obtain'd Leave to go to any
Place within ten Miles of the
town for the Preservation of his

Frenchman, who 'tis said had

Minister to raise a Rebellion
amongst the Corsicans against

proper Hand to employ among

his lodgings at the House of
Lochyell, a Gentleman who
was in the late Rebellion;
whose Son, though he enjoy'd
his Estate by the Lenity of the

joined him, and rais'd what
Men he could for his Service.
There they continued for some
Time in a private Manner, 'til
hearing of Sir John Cope's
Design to march and disperse
them, they found it necessary to
set up their Standard, and raise
all the force they could to
oppose him. On this they were
join'd by several of the other
Clans of that county, and chose,
as the most advantageous
Situation, the Pass of
corrieyerroch, where they
determin'd to meet him; this
Pass being so form'd both by
Nature and Art, that 100 Men
could destroy 1000 in
attempting to pass that Way.

express, either to go to Fort
Augustus or Inverness, his
Intention was to make for the
first of these Places; but being
advertis'd from Inverness of the
Danger of passing that Way,
and that the Rebels wished he
should attempt it, he made a
Shaw of marching thither, but
turned towards Inverness,
expecting in his Route to be
join'd by several of the well-
affected Clans: But some of
their Chiefs being out of the
Way, and their Tenants mostly
employed in Harvest, none of
them join'd him 'til he left
Inverness, when 200 of the
Monroes follow'd him to
Aberdeen, most of whom
would have embark'd with him,
had it been thought necessary;
but it was judged more
advisable to let them return
home, for the Defence of their
own Country, and to quell any
Infurrections of the Disaffected
that might be in these Parts;
and no other Highlandman
accompanied Sir John but three
Companies of Lord Loudon's
new-rais'd High-land
Regiment.
The General came to Dunbar
on the 16th Inst. and landed
next Day, having brought with
him all the Town of Aberdeen's
Arms, because it was thought
the Rebels, under Gordon of
Glenbucket, would visit that
Town soon after he left it.
When the General took his
Route towards Inverness, the
Rebels came down to the Low
Country, and were joined by
the Athol and Perthshire Men at
Perth; where they remained
about ten Days, and when they
went off the exacted 1000 l.
from the Town, and then
marched Southward, and
crossed the Forth above
Sterling; whence, it was
thought, they would have
directed their March to the
Shire of Air by Glasgow, and
proceeded thence by Dumfries
to England: But, instead of this,
they only deputed two Persons
to go to Glasgow, and demand
15,000 l. and turned towards
Edinburgh directly, being not
only invited, but solicited
thereto, by the Jacobites in and
about the City, who well knew
that the well affected
Inhabitants would have baffled
any Attempt upon it, if they had
got the Fencing of the City
finished, and the thousand Men
levied and tarried, who were to
be rais'd by voluntary
Subscription. Besides these,
800 of the chief Inhabitants of
the City, Lawyers, Writers,
Physicians, and even Divines,
took up Arms for the Defence
of the Town. About 23
Patternaryes and Ship Guns
were placed at the Gates, and

Sunday Night, and Likewise on
Monday 'til Five o'Clock in the
Afternoon; at which Time
Gardner's and Hamilton's
Dragoons not only retired from
the Colt bridge towards the
City, but likewise precipitantly
retir'd thence towards
Musselburgh, on the Approach
of the Van Guard of the Rebels,
and that in the Sight of the
Inhabitants of the City; which
put them into no small
Confusion, imagining the
Rebels were at their Heels with
their whole Force, and that the
Dragoons had entirely deserted
them. However, the Volunteers,
&c. continued under Arms,
waiting Orders to take their
respective Stations, which they
were resolved to defend to the

Isle, was filled immediately
with Persons who had been
strolling through the Street,
many of them disaffected to the
present Government. In this
Meeting a Letter from the
Chevalier was presented,
intimating his Intention to enter
the City; but the Reader was
soon interrupted and the
Question put, Whether the
Town was or was not tenable?
some affirming, that the
Dragoons had left them, and
others, that it was false, if
required. In the mean Time the
Secretary at War acquainted
them that he had an Order from
the General, to desire the two
Regiments of Dragoons to enter
the City, if the Inhabitants
desired it. This occasioned
some warm Debates, when a
Gentleman, who had been
present at a Council of War
some Days before, asserted,
that the general Opinion of the
Officers was, that the City was
not tenable, and that bringing
the Dragoons into it would be
cooping them up to their
Destruction. Immediately the
Vote was put, Receive the
Dragoons or not? when it
passed in the Negative, and
they joined General Cope. No
Orders being given what Part
the Volunteers should act, they
delivered their Arms into the
Castle; the Governor of which
sent for the Cannon on the
Walls and Gates, to be brought
to the Castle or nailed up; but
for want of Orders from some
Person in Town, they could not
be carried away, but fell into
the Rebels Hands, Part of
whom entered the Town next
Morning, by the Nether Bow
Port, when open'd to let in a
Coach. The Remainder took
Possession about Noon that
Day, where they continued 'til
Thursday, when, hearing of Sir
John Cope's Approach to attack
them, and the Garrison having
thrown some Granades into the
Town, to force them out, they
marched to Falside Hill, in
View of our Camp, on the Sea
side, near Preston-pans, where
our Army lay all Night under
Arms.
In the Morning, about five, the
Highlanders march'd up to our
Army in Battle Array, and
began their Attack on the Right
Wing, in which Gardner's
Dragoons were placed, who
broke upon receiving the first
Fire of the Rebels, and went
off. Their Officers persuaded
them to rally, but just as they
were returning along-side of
Lord Grange's Park dyke, and
Ambuscade of Rebels gave
them a second Fire, which
made them run off altogether,
notwithstanding the most
earnest Intreaties of their
Officers. Hamilton's Dragoons
went off immediately also,
without firing a Shot;and the
Foot, surprised at the Flight of
the Dragoons, (on whose
Service they placed such great
Confidence) and it being very
dark, their Bayonets not fix'd,
and a great Number of new
raised Men among them, they
fir'd too soon; on which the
Highlanders rushed upon them,
Sword in Hand, with great
Fury, surrounded them, killed
about 150 Men, and made
about 1000 Prisoners. The
Highlanders, of Loudon's
Regiment placed with General
Cope's Baggage, and as a Body
of Reserve, were fallen upon
next, who behav'd very well,
gave the Rebels a smart Fire,
and kill'd several of them; but
being overpower'd by
Numbers, they were obliged to
surrender Prisoners.
Our Army consisted only of
2800 Men, and the Rebels were
reckoned at 6000. A great
Number of Volunteers from
Edinburgh and the Country
round it, ofter'd to fight the
Rebels, but Sir John refused
their Assistance, for Fear of
confusing his Men. The Rebels
had about 100 Men killed, and
double that Number wounded.

sending us so few Troops, and
taking our Friends the Dutch

enough to think, that the
Preparations and Stand we have
made so far, has stopt the
Rebels, and consequently sav'd
the Northern Counties. The
Rebels are certainly ten
thousand strong, and threaten
us hard. The Laird of

made a lucky Sally with his

one Man, and wounding
another, so that we are no

Fortress. Their Siege of Blair
Castle is like to turn to the
same Account, tho' that is more
properly a Blockade, since even
their advanced Parties were
never within a Mile of the

CROMARTIE, on being
asked, Why Judgment of
Death should not pass
against Him.
MY LORDS,
I HAVE now the Misfortune to
appear before your Lordships,
guilty of an Offence of such a
Nature as justly merits the
highest Indignation of his
Majesty; your Lordships; and
the Publick: And it was from a
Conviction of my Guilt that I
did not presume to trouble your
Lordships with any Defence.
As I have committed Treason it
is the last Thing I would
attempt to justify. My only Plea
shall be your Lordships
Compassion; my only Refuge
his Majesty's Clemency. Under
his heavy Load of Affliction I
have still the Satisfaction, my
Lords, of hoping that my past
Conduct before the breaking
out of the Rebellion was
irreproachable, as to my
Attachment to the present
happy Establishment both in
Church and State: And in
Evidence of my Affection to
the Government, upon the
breaking out the Rebellion, I
appeal to the then Commander
in Chief of his Majesty's Forces
at Inverness and to the Lord
President of the Court of
Session in Scotland, who I am
sure will do Justice to my
Conduct upon that Occasion.
But, my Lords, notwithstanding
my determined Resolution in
favour of the Government, I
was unhappily seduced from
that Loyalty in an unguarded
Moment, by the Arts of
desperate and designing Men
And it is notorious, my Lords,
that no sooner did I awake from
the Delusion, than I felt a
Remorse for my Departure
from my Duty, but it was then
too late.
Nothing, my Lords, remains
but to throw my self, my Life
and Fortune upon your
Lordships Compassion; but of
these, my Lords as to myself, is
the least Part of my Suffering. I
have involved an affectionate
Wife with an unborn Infant as
Parties of my Guilt to share its
Penalties, I have involved my
eldest Son, whose Infancy and
Regard to his Parents, hurried
him down to the Stream of
Rebellion; I have involved also
Eight innocent Children who
must feel their Parent's
Punishment before they know
his Guilt. Let them, my Lords,
be Pledges to his Majesty; Let
them be Pledges to your
Lordships; Let them be Pledges
to my Country for Mercy; Let
the silent Eloquence of their
Grief and Tests; Let the
powerful Language of innocent
Nature supply my Want of
Eloquence and Persuasion; Let
me enjoy Mercy, but no longer
than I deserve it; and let me no
longer enjoy Life than I shall
use it to deface the Crimes I
have been guilty of. Whilst I
thus interceed to his Majesty
through the Mediation of your
Lordships for Mercy; Let my
Remorse for my Guilt as a
Subject; Let the Sorrow of my
Heart as a Husband; Let the
Anguish of my Mind as a
Father, speak the Rest of my
Misery. As you Lordships are
Men, feel as Men, but may
none of you ever suffer the
smallest Part of my Anguish.
But if, after all, my Lords, my
Safety, shall be found
inconsistent with that of the
Publick, and nothing but my
Blood can stone for my
unhappy Crime; If the Sacrifice
of my Life, my Fortune and
Family, is judged indispensably
necessary for stopping the loud
Demands of publick Justice;
and if the bitter Cup is not to
pass from me, not mine, but
they Will, O God, be done.",nonslave

the most dangerous
consequence to the security of

of the crown.

POLITICAL MAXIMS
and PROPHECIES,
lately discover'd in a
Heap of old musty
Papers.
1. WHEN Wickedness wriggles
into high Station with Cunning
and Address, the worst of Fools
have the best Chance for
Preferment, because those only
are proper Tools for such a
Workman.
2. When a Groupe of Fools has
nestled into a warm Situation,
they may keep it by
Confederacy, in spite of
common Sense and Honesty.
Thus it has actually happen'd,
that great States have ""been
often hag-rid by a Confederacy
of Fools, till the united Breath
of an injur'd People has puffed
them to this D.
3. Athens and Rome in their
Declension were fway'd by
Orators, who, by cajoling the
People with high Pretences to
Patriotism, and by lashing the
Fools of Power, were the only
Men admitted to a Participation
of it; for, the more you lash a
Fool the more be will love you.
4. Wits also are entitled to the
Favour of Fools, because Wit is
an. Antithesis to the Judgment;
nor has it any natural
Connection with good Sense,
or common Honesty.
5. When therefore Wits and
Orators are grafted upon the
Stock of Fools, the Fruits will
be Corruption, Venality,
Rapaciousness, Prodigality,
Jobbs, Expeditions ill
concerted, and executed worse,
Fears of Invasion, Orders, a
Perfects to Fluctuation of
Councils, Cowardice, and an
powerful Determination to
make a wrong Use fortunate
Event.
6. Wisdom will cry aloud in
vain for good Politic for her
Voice cannot be heard in the
Buz of World.
7. The Resemblance of Wisdom
then becomes a Candidate of
Power; and the Shew of with
high Spirit may fill the Place of
real , but the Meteor will
vanish in a short leaving a
nauseous Scent behind.
8. When Pride; Presumption,
Impetuosity Self-sufficiency,
and a Contempt for others, life
Ambition into the Seat of
Power, it must soon tumble
down like Photon, on set the
World on Fire.
9. Whether a mad Fool, or a
Combination of wicked Fools,
are predominant in Society, its
Fate will be the fame, for it
must sink to Perdition in both
Cases: in the former more
precipitately; in the latter by a
lingering Consumption.
10. As Honesty is the best
Policy in private Life, so is it in
the Administration or publick
Affairs; for, Honesty attracts
the Love of all the Virtuous, the
Veneration of all the Wicked,
and the Confidence of both.
But who will trust either a rash
or a dishonest Fool ?
11. A Premier, or, in the
Asiatick, Stile a Vizier, may be
a fit Instrument of despotick
Power, because the Good of the
People is no Part of its Policy;
but the Government of a free
State is not to be safely trusted
to any other Hand than that of
the Monarch: because being
exalted to the highest Point of
Honour; and surrounded with
Affluence, he cannot be
tempted to misrule, by the Want
of any Gratifications which the
Heart of Man can reasonably
desire.
12. But when a Subject is
trusted with the sole
Administration of Royal Power,
he is under the strongest
Temptation of Ambition and
Avarice, to injure both his
Sovereign and the People. All
his Misconduct he will impute
to the Master, and every
accidental success he will
assume to himself. The upright
Intention of the Crown will be
misrepresented to the People,
and the Affection of the Subject
misrepresented to the Crown.
Hence Distrust on one Side,
add Disaffection on the other,
till both become the Vassals
perhaps, the Sacrifice of M
Power.

Minister dictates to his
Sovereign with Papal
Authority. But the Tyranny
shall he short Durant's. For, as

Corruption, he extinguish'd by,

an illustrious, an adopted Race
of Heroes, an Patrons of
Liberty, and Lovers of

with he following most
gracious Speech from the
Throne.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
As One of My principal Views,
in calling this Parliament, was,
that I might receive the most
clear and certain Information of
the Sense of My People, on the
present Posture of Affairs; I
was desirous to meet you as
early as your own Convenience
as well as that of the Publick,
would admit.
By the Advice of My
Parliament, I entered into the
War against Spain, in order to
vindicate and secure the Trade
and Commerce of My Subjects.
By their Advice also, and in
Conformity to My
Engagement, I undertook the
Support of the Empress Queen
of Engary, and of the just
Rights of the House of Austria.
In Resentment for this
Conduct, so necessary for the
Interests of My own Kingdoms,
and of the ancient Allies of My
Crown, France not only
declared War against Me, but
fomented and supported an
Unnatural Rebellion within this
Kingdom. In carrying on this
1st and necessary War, I have
found the most cheerful and
vigorous Support from My
Parliament : And tho' the
Success has not been
answerable to Our Wishes, and
just Expectations, in the Low
Countries; yet it must be
allowed, to the Honour of this
Nation, that no Part of the
Misfortune can be imputed on
Us.
The signal Successes, which it
has pleased God to grant Us at
Sea, have made the Enemy feel
the Weight of Our Naval
Strength, to their great Loss,
and the real and solid
Advantage of this Nation. This
has appeared most remarkable
in the Operations of My Fleet,
this last Years which have
tended no less to the Honour of
the British Flag, than on the
Reduction of the Maritime
Commerce of France. The
Governess of the United
Provinces has, once more,
resumed that Consistency,
which will give great Strength
to the Common Cause : cement
more firmly the Friendship
between this Kingdom and that
Republick; and be a lasting
Security to Our inseparable
Interests. One great Effect of
this happy Alteration in
Holland has already appeared,
in the vigorous Declaration
lately made by the States
General to the Court of France;
and the Orders given by them,
for committing Hostilities
every where against the French
King and his Subjects.
Some Overtures for a General
Pacification have lately been
made to me, on the Part of
France, and though some of the
Terms proposed were such as
could not be approved, yet as I
have no other Aim, but to bring
about a safe and honorable
Peace, I have shewn the utmost
Inclination to facilitate it, in
Conjunction with My Allies;
and a Congress is actually
agreed to be held at Mixle
Chaselle, whichever the several
Ministers will soon repair. I
hope all the Powers concerned
will bring with them the same
Dispositional to associate this
great Work, on just and
reasonable Conditions, which I
sincerely have.
In this Situation, I am confident
you will agree in Opinion with
Me, that it is necessary to be
vigilant and attentive to every
Event; and that there can be no
Reason to expect a good Peace,
but by being timely prepared to
carry on a vigorous and
effectual War. I therefore rel on
your hearty and powerful
Support, so enable Me to
prosecute the War, in case the
Obstinacy of Our Enemies, in
not agreeing to just and
reasonable Terms of
Accommodation, should render
it unavoidable. For this Purpose
I am now actually concerning
the necessary Measures with
My Allies : whose Interests I
am determined to adhere to and
support. Let Us be in
Readiness, in case the
Negotiations should fail of the
desired Effects, to convince
Our Enemies, how much they
are mistasten, if they vainly
imagine that Great Britain, and
Her Allies, will submit to
receive Law from any Power
whatsoever and demonstrate to
the World, that We will decline
no Difficulty or Hazard for the
Preservation of the Common
Liberty, and our own In
dependency, and effential
Interests.
Gentlemen of the House of
Commons,
The Necessity of adequate
Supplies appears from what has
been already mentioned. The
proper Estimates for the
Service of the ensuing Year
shall be laid before you; and I
desire you to grant Me such
Supplies, as your own Security
and lasting Welfare, and the
present critical and important
Situation of Affairs, require.
You may depend on their being
applied only to the Purposes for
which they shall be given; and
if, by the falling out of Events,
any Saving can be made, it
shall be duly accounted for.
My Lords, and Gentlemen,
If any farther Provision shall be
found expedient, to render
more effectual the good Laws
lately made for the Security of
the present Establishment,
extinguishing the Spirit of
Rebellion, and for the better
civilizing, improving, and
reducing into Order, any Part of
the United Kingdom, I depend
on your known Affection to Me
and to your country, seriously
and early to set about so good a
Work. I will only add, that
there never was Conjuncture, in
which Unanimity, Firmness,
and Dispatch, were more
necessary for the Safety,
Honour, and true Interest of
Great Britain.",nonslave

The South Carolina Gazette,NA,Peter Timothy,1748_10_10,"October 10, 1748",1748,"As the insurrections in
Holland, and the
alteration thereby
decasion'd, is one of the
most important
occurrences since our
last, we shall begin with
an account of that affair.
A part of the publick revenue of
the united provinces was raised
by small duties or taxes, call'd
pachts in Dutch, upon almost
all the necessaries of life: These
packhts were farmed out to
private men, who for that
reason were called pachters,
and who were empowered by
law to raise and collect them by
their own officers, of whom
they kept a great number in
daily pay, besides a good many
informers; and as they
generally had good bargains,
they not only grew rich, but
lived i a more sumptuous
manner than most private men
were able to do, which raised
both the envy and jealousy of
the people in every one of the
seven provinces. The populace
n the province of Groningen
were the first that began, about
the end of last month, to appear
in a tumultuous manner against
these pachters, and to demand
an abolition of all these duties
as well as a redress of some
other grievances. In this
province the states were so wife
as to prevent any fatal
consequences by an immediate
compliance with the demands
of the populace: but the states
of Frisland being a little more
obstinate, the tumults of the
populace in that country came
to a greater height, especially
as they hadnot yet settled the
stadtholdership, in the same
manner as it had been settled
by most of the other provinces.
The mob not only plundered
and demolished all the houses
of the pachters in that province,
but also the houses of some of
those gentlemen who were
thought averse to any alteration
in the government : so that the
states were as last obliged to
comply with all their demands,
which consisted of 14 articles,
the chief of which were, 1st,
That the stadtholdership and
succession there into should be
established in the family of
Orange as it was in most of the
other provinces, 2dly, That all
the farms of the country and
cities should be so abolished as
never to be re-established. 3dly,
That a commission should be
appointed to extaing into the
state of finances and treasury of
the province; and there for
abolishing certain superfluous
employments, and diminishing
the appointments of others, and
their power to extend to mility
as well as civil employments :
and a third, to examine the boo
of suffrages on p0ll-book, and
to reform all buses therein. The
populace of the provine of
Utrecht began likewise to sheer
the same sum ultuous spitit, but
the states prevented their
commuting violence, by a
compliance with their demands.
At last the infection reached the
province of Holland, where the
states thought to have
prevented any violent
proceedings, by a fort of
debecupry proclamation setting
forth the Inconveniencies that
would attend the abolition of
the taxes, and threatening the
refractory with severe
punishment; but this had a
quite contrary effect, for the
mob rose as Harlene,
Amsterdam,Leydres, and the
Hague, and were more
outrageous than they had been
any where else ; and as they
were fired upon by the burghers
both at Amsterdam and the
Hagur, a great many were
killed, wounded, to death or
drowned in the camels, which
their fury, so that the houses
and goods of every one of the
pachters in or about all those
were demolished, and in such
works consequences might
have ensued, if it had not been
for the sensenable speech made
on that Occasion by the Prince
of Orange to the Cites of
Holland and and their
resolution thereupon, to abolish
all the forms, And to contrive
some other methods for
supplying the deficiency them
by so in the public revenue;
which will of course greatly
add to the power and influence
of him for as highness, as all or
of the party, of to him and the
new offers to be appointed as
some must be, for raising and
collecting any new taxes that
may be imposed, will all be of
his nomination.
Stockholm, May, 25. To the
Declaration of the English
Minister at this Court (See our
Goethe No. 754) Count Tellin
has made the following Answer
: 'The King, Sir, does not know

Majesty imagines he has

charged with giving any
Obstruction to your
Compliance with them, you
will receive herewith the
Passports you desired. You are
very sensible the King's
Moderation springs solely from
his Regard for your Court. His
Majesty, Sir, has commanded
me to acquaint you in his
Name, that he will never
confound the Consideration he
bears to his B Majesty and the
English Nation, with the just
Complaints which he has been
obliged to make against your
Conduct and during your Stay
here; and that he will always

supposed, that the late
mobs and Insurrections
in the United Provinces,
were privately fomented

they were designed by
those that first raised the
fire, wherefore some of

Two in particular, a man and a
woman, who were said to be
ring-leaders in the tumults at
Amsterdam, were hanged there
the 28th ult. N.S. During the
time of execution, the populace
assembled, in a tumultuous
manner, and made some
advances, as if they intended to
rescue the criminals; but all the
avenues to the place of
execution being guarded by the
burghers, or chief citizens,
upon the mob's attempting to
force one of these avenues, the
burghers fired upon them, by
which between twenty and
thirty were wounded, or killed
dead on the spot; and the
confusion thereby occasioned
was so great, that a
considerable number of the
spectators, as well as the mob,
were pushed into the canals,
some of whom were drowned;
and several others were crushed
or trampled to death: Yet, as
this mischief was done by the
burghers, it occasioned no
murmurs; whereas, had it been
done by regular troops, it might
have occasioned a general
insurrection, unless there had
been an army in the town
sufficient to hold the whole
people in subjection. Some
others have been likewise
executed at the Hague, by

Friesland the confusion grows
daily greater, so that it has been
resolved to send thither a
deputation from the States

people of that province; and, at
the same time, several
regiments have been ordered to
march that way, which will
probably have a greater effect. The last Letters from

Arrival of a Ship from

Saxony, BIRON, or prince
LEWIS of Brunswick; and
that they would have done
this previous to, or during the
sessions of the Polish dyet, of
which the dukes of Courland
are oblige to receive
investiture in toke of
dependence. There was a
report, that court
MAURICE, flushed with new

his success, would again

Assembly of the Island of JAMAICA.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Council and Assembly of your Majesty's Island of Jamaica ; crave Leave to approach your Royal Throne, being convinced we should be wanting in that Duty we owe your Majesty, and the Trust reposed in us, if we did not take the earliest Occasion of laying before your Majesty those Burthens which disturb the happiness of your People, and threaten Ruin and Destruction to a Colony of such Importance to your Majesty's Government.

The Expence in supporting that just and necessary War, which your Majesty engaged in for vindicating the Trade of your Subjects, and supporting the Liberty and Independancy of Europe, called upon us to bear a Part of that Burthen, which we did with a Warmth and Chearfulness disproportioned to our Abilities, and as we apprehend in a much greater Degree than the rest of your Subjects.

These were our Efforts whilst we were labouring under an Additional Duty on Molasses-Spirits, which, though unavoidable from the Exigency of the Times, does in a most grievous Manner affect the Inhabitants in general, but more particularly the poorer Sort, and prevents the Cultivations of the unsettled Lands, it being evident that Sugar produced from new Lands, abounds with a greater Proportion of Syrup, than that raised from old Plantations.

And whilst we were under the pressure of that Duty, we had the Mortification to find ourselves subjected to a further Tax of One Shilling and Six-pence per Hundred imposed the last Session of Parliament upon all sugar produced from your Majesty's Colonies, which we fear, if continued, must in the End transfer that valuable Commodity to our great Rivals in Trade, the natural Enemies of your Majesty's Crown and Government.

Permit us further, most Gracious Sovereign, to represent our just apprehension of a further Distress arising from the Interruption of a free Navigation in these Seas, being informed that the Spaniards, our dangerous and jealous Neighbours, have detained, and searched on the high Seas, a Vessel belonging to your Majesty's Subjects, bound to this Island, as may appear by two Affidavits, which we humbly beg leave to lay before your Majesty.

These, Royal Sir, are Melancholly Truths, and the true Causes of our Distress. From these Causes arise our want of Money, and Credit, both at home and abroad. From thence the scarcity of Inhabitants in a Country so extensive and so happily situated for Trade may easily be accounted for, notwithstanding the great Encouragement given by our Laws every white Person shall become a Settler.

From these a further Desertion of our Island is to be justly apprehended, and under such Circumstances, we cannot think of any other Means of Security, then an immediate Protection from your majesty's great Care and Tenderness of your Subjects.

These Considerations oblige us to renew our Applications to your Majesty for another Regiment of Soldiers to guard and defend us: Daily apprehensive of an Insurrection of our Negroes , and thereby in Danger of loosing whatever in our distress'd Condition remains valuable.

We therefore do most humbly beseech your Majesty to take into your Royal Consideration this our humble Address and Representation, and that you will be pleased to grant us such Relief as is [ ] to your Majesty's great Goodness and Wisdom.",blackUnrest

he had brought into his
design all the slaves in the
island, to the number of
15,000, who, at a certain

making themselves masters of
the island, as it is ill fortified,

soldiers out cruizing, and
were assured of speedy
assistance from the Algerians,

language, and overheard a
conversation of the

named Cara [ ], who had
seiz'd upon his galley, after
fomenting a mutiny among
the crew: At first he was
confined in the castle of St. [

out at the French court's
instance, and this fortress
assign'd him for his prison.
At present he has a guard of
soldiers set over him, until his

intentions concerning him, in

the Bashaw and the other
accomplices did at first
intend to poison the Grand
Master, but had since resolv'd
to massacre him; in the
execution of which design
they were to have made use of
the keys which one Famitier,
a Turk, had got made to the
doors of the inner palace,
where they were to have been
introduced by some slaves,
who lodg'd there, and were
concern'd in the plot. The

ENEMIES.
NO Virtue is more frequently
mentioned, and less practised
than Friendship. Every Man
imagine he has Friends; yet
every Man may here find
himself deceived. What we
generally call Friendship is a
spurious Virtue, that vanishes
in Time of Trial. Adversity is
the Touchstone of Friendship,
King Tarquin declared it owing
to his Misfortunes, and
Banishment, that he ever
discovered who were his
Friends, or Enemy; before he
could then no longer oblige
them. Such Observations have
opened the Eyes of others,
upon finding themselves
deserted in Misfortune by those
they esteemed their fastest
Friends. Aulus Gellius has
preserved to me an elegant
Fable of AEsop, to this
Purpose.
""A .
Malevolence must be carefully
avoided, he followed, in
chusing a middle Way, betwixt
that of Friendship with all we
meet, and of suspecting every
Month. It is in g a Polly to
believes no Body, as every
Body.
Friendship is often confounded
with a Party a Men f join
Instead of uniting in Virtue. Let
a Thing be good, it if carried
too far. All the Virtue have their
Lucks, should never be passed.
Genuine Friendship com in the
close Union of two or those
Persons, who inwardly love
and each other's Welfare as
their own, in all god and
Designs only: Otherwise the
Junction loses the Name and
Nature of Friendship; and turns
to Combination and
Conspiracy. If one Man obliges
himself to and justify all the
Actions of another, whether
they be good or bad night or
wrong; this is not Virtue or
Friendship, but Vice and V. For
there can be no Friendship but
betwixt good Men. When had
Men unite in the same Desires,
Fears, Animosities,
Endeavours, and E; this is not
Friendship, but Combination or
Faction. It is a goo Error, to call
this Kind of Junction,
Friendship; and arises from the
Propensity of the Vulgar, to
confound Virtues and Vices.
The People look upon
Friendship as an offensive and
detective on all Occasions,
good, bad and indifferent.
When a Drunkard, a an
Adulterer &c. is accused; these
Vulgar Wretches think it their
Duty to defend, or bring of
their Friends; and censure those
who will not endeavour to
blanch and conceal such
Enormities. But, if this be
Friendship, the patronizing of
Thieves and Robbers is Virtue.
According to these bad
Principles, the famous
Cartouche was a Hero, who
suffered the several Penalties,
for some Years, without
betraying this Gang; thinking
the Law of Friendship required
this obstinate Behaviour. Yet
many among the Vulgar
admired and praised this sturdy
Resolution, as a Sign of one
Courage and Friendship.
Daily Experience shews, that
few Men distinguish betwixt
Friendship and Conspiracy.
Even Philosophers, and the
Learned, have been guilty of
this Error. Chiton, one of the
seven wise Greeks, once
doubted h to behave as a Judge,
in an unjust Cause of his
Friend. On the one Side, he
considered the Transgression of
the Law; and on the other the
Transgrossen of Friendship; so
that he took the Medium
betwixt the Twice Sentence
upon his guilty Friends, but
upon the to acquit him; and
friend he thereby fulfilled the
Duty both of a Judge and
Friend. These the Philosopher
sacrificed his Character of
Honesty to a of friendship: For,
to judge contrary to law or pers
others to same Thing, as to the
Fact; tho' indeed the is the
Crime, because it adds
Counting to Injunction. An
honest Man will not regard the
Person of his Friend, when
appointed his, Judge Yet many
great Men besides Chilon, have
given him this Error; as appears
among numerous Instances,
from the Explanation of
Gullius, upon this very
Procedure of Chilon: For
Gellius thinks, that the
Philosophers took an excellent
middle Way; ""to as to refers
violent with due Bounds."" We
likewise see that Ch himself
was guilt of an Error, in
declaring that ""a Man should
not refuse a small Disgrace, in

our last Accounts from the
East-Indies, the Dutch are
likely to lose, is situated
between 102 and 113 Degrees
of Eastern Longitude, and
between and 8 Degrees of
South Latitude, being about
700 Miles long from East to
West. Most Part of this Island
was under the Dominion of the
Dutch, and besides the native
Javans, is inhabited by Chinese
Malayans, and various other
Nations, transplanted thither by
the Dutch from other oriental
Countries which they had
subdued. The Dutch maintained
such a Fleet of Men of War in
the Ports of Java, that they gave
Law to the Europeans, who
ended in those Seas, as well as
to the Natives, and actually
excluded the English, and all
other Nations from those
Countries where the fine Spices
grow. Java is mountainous in
the Middle, but level and
encumber'd with Boggs near
the Shore, except near Batavia
and Bantam and other Dutch
Colonies, where the Lands are
well drained and cultivated. It
is not one of the Spice Islands,
but produces Rice, Sugar,
Coffee, and such Fruits as grow
between the Tropics. About
thirty Years ago the whole
Dutch Colony was on the Point
of being destroyed by a
Conspiracy among the
Javanese, which was no less
than 7 Years in Agitation, many
Thousand Persons were privy
to it, and yet it did not break
out till a very few Days before
the Time fix'd for putting it in
Execution, which was the 2d of
January 1722. This Conspiracy
was headed by one Erberfield,
the Son of a Dutch Gentleman,
by an Indian Woman, who,
with 18 of his Followers was
put to Death. A more dangerous
Conspiracy broke out in 1740,
by the Chinese, who, by their
superior Skill in mercantile
Affairs, had grown rich and
powerful; and, as the Dutch
gave out, entered into Plots to
dispossess them of the Island.
The Dutch reported that they
were attacked by 90,000 of the
Chinese without the City of
Batavia, and that they had no
Way to secure themselves but
by a general Massacre of the
Chinese within the City, tho' by
delivering up their Weapons,
they were Men entirely naked
and unarmed. This dreadful
Massacre was put in Execution
on the 9th of October 1740, in
which no less than 20,000 Men,
Women, and Children, were
destroyed; and as not only the
Governor but many of the
Soldiers, and others, grew
immensely rich by the Plunder
of the Chinese, it was suspected
that the Wealth of that People
was the grand Inducement
which the Dutch had to fall
upon them. The Dutch in
Europe, indeed, pretended to be
alarmed at the Barbarity of the
Action, and sent Orders to
Batavia to try the Governor for
the Fact; but from this bloody
Deed it may be supposed that
the present Insurrection of the
Chinese takes its Rise.",nonslave

entirely evacuated; and by the

buildings in ashes for 15 miles
in length on the Northerly side
of the river, and about the order
side; and when they house, they
discovered foot tracks lately
made, and soon after perceived

wounded some others. But a

Lisbon, March 1754.
My dear Friend,
BY this Time I suppose you
have heard of my being at
Lisbon, and are wondering
what led me thither, especially
since my last informed you of
my Intention of going to
Georgia by Way of New-York.
This was really my Design at
the Time of my Writing; but
being afterward called by
Providence to take with me
several Orphan Children, I
thought it most advisable to go
and settle them, and my other
domestic, Affairs at the
Orphan-House first; that I
might visit the Northern Parts
of America with more Ease and
Freedom in my own Mind.It
happened that the Success,
Capt. Thomson, bound for
Port-Royal, South Carolina,
(which is not very far from
Georgia) was then almost ready
to fail.I sent for the Owner,
and finding that the Ship was to
touch at Lisbon to unload some
Wheat, it occasioned a little
Demurr; but upon second
Thoughts, believing it might be
serviceable to me, as a Preacher
and Protestant, and Protestant,
to fee something of the
Superstitions of the Church of
Rome, I took my Passage and
embarked in the success, on the
7th of March,On the 14th we
reached Cape Finnister.On
the 15th came in Sight of the
Burlings; and on the 16th
anchored safe before Bellem,
about four Miles from Lisbon
City, the Metropolis of
Portugal.As I knew Nobody
there, and had formed but an
indifferent Idea of the
Inhabitants, form the Account
that had been given me of
them, I had purposed within
myself to keep on Board, and
go ashore only now and then in
the Day-time.But Providence
ordered it so. that a Gentleman
of the Factory, who had heard
me himself, and whose brother
had been awakened under my
Ministry some years ago,
Immediately, upon hearing of
my Arrival, sent me an Offer of
his House during me Stay.I
thankfully accepted it; and
special Leave being procured
for my going ashore, I was
carried in a Chaise and Pair
from Bellem to Lisbon.A
new Scene, both in respect to
the Situation of the Place, the
Fashion of the Buildings, and
the Dress of the Inhabitants
presented itself all the Way.
But what engaged my Attention
most, was the Frequency of
Curcifixes and little image of
the Virgin Mary, and other real
or reputed Saints, which were
placed almost in every Street,
or fixed against the Walls of the
Houses almost at every
Turning, with Lamps hanging
before them.To there I
observed the People bow as
they passed along; and near
some of them stood several
little Companies, singing with
great Earnestness.This
seemed to me very odd, and
gave me an Idea of what further
ecclesiastical Curiosities would
probably fall in my Way, if I
should be detained any Time
here.There Expectations
were quickly raised;For, not
long after my Arrival at my
new Lodgings, (where I was
received and entertained with
great Gentility, Hospitality and
Friendliness) upon looking out
of the Window, I saw a
Company of Priests and Friars
bearing lighted Wax Tapers,
and attended by various Sorts
of people, some of which had
Bags and Baskets of Victuals in
their Hands, and others carried
Provisions on their Shoulders
upon Sticks between two. After
these followed a mixed
Multitude, singing with a very
audible Noice, and addressing
the Virgin Mary in their usual
Strain, ""Ora pro nobis."" In this
Manner they proceed to the
Prison, where all was deposited
for the Use of the poor Persons
confined therein.But a far
more pompous Procession of
the like Nature (as a Stander-by
informed me) passed by a few
Days after.In this there were
near three hundred Franciscan
Friars, many of which (besides
Porters hired for that Purpose)
were loaded with a Variety of
Food; and those who bore no
Burden carried either Ladies or
Spoons in their HandsSights
of this Nature being quite a
Novelty to me, I was fond of
attending as many of them as I
could. Two Things concurred to
make them more frequent at
this Juncture, viz. the Season of
Lent, and an excessive
Drought, which threatened the
total Destruction of the Fruits
of the EarthFor the averting
to great a Judgment, and for the
imploring the much longed for
Blessing of Rain, daily
Processions had been make
from one Convent or another
for a considerable Time.One
of there I saw. It was looked
upon as a pretty grand one,
being made up of the Carmelite
Friars, the Parish Priests, and a
great Number of what they call
Brothers of the order, who
walked two by two in divers
Habits, holding a long and very
large lighted Wax Taper in their
right Hands.Amidst these
was carried upon eight or ten
Men's Shoulders a tall Image of
the VirginMary in a kind of
Men's Attire; for I think the had
a very fine white Wig on her
Head, (a Dress the often
appears in) and was much
adorned with Jewels and
glittering Stones.At some
Distance from the Lady, under
a Canopy of State, and
supported likewise by fix or
eight Persons, came a Priest,
holding in his Hand some noted
Relick.After him followed
several, Thousands of People,
joining with the Friars in
singing, Eandem cantilenam,
""Ora pre Nobis,"" all the way
Still Rain was denied, and still
processions were continued.
At length the Clouds began to
gather, and the Mercury in the
Barometer fell very much.
Then was brought out a
wooden Image, which they say
never failed.It was the Figure
of our blessed Lord, clothed
with Purple Robes, and crown'd
with Thorns. I think they call
him the Lord of the Passion.
Upon his Shoulders he bore a
large Cross, under the Weight
of which he was represented as
stooping 'till his Body bent
almost double.He was
brought from the Le Grass
Convent in very great Pomp,
and placed in a large Cathedral
ChurchBeing on Board at
that Time, I lost this Sight: but
the subsequent Evening I
beheld the Seigneur fixed on an
Eminence in a large Cathedral
Church, near the Alter,
surrounded with Wax-Tapers of
a prodigious SizeHe was
attended by many Noblemen,
and thousands of Spectators of
all Ranks and Stations, who
crowded from every Quarter,
and in their Turns, were
admitted by the Guards to
come within the Rails and
perform their Devotions.This
they expressed by kneeling,
and kissing the Seigneur's Heel,
by putting their left and right
Eye to it, and then touching it
with their Beads, which a
Gentleman in waiting received
from them and then returned
again.This Scene was
repeated three days
successively: and during all this
Time the Church and Space
before it was so thronged with
Carriage and people, that there
was scarce any passing. The
Music on this Occasion was
extremely soft, and the Church
was illuminated in a very
shirking Manner.The third
Day in the Forenoon it rained,
and soon after the Seigneur,
was conducted home in as great
Splendour, and much greater
Rejoicing than when he was
brought forth. As my
Situation was very
commodious I saw the whole;
and afterwards went and heard
Part of the Sermon, which was
delivered before him in the
Church to which the Seigneur
belonged.The Preacher was
full of Action; and in some Part
of his Discourse, (as one who
understood Portuguese
informed me) pointing to the
Image he said, ""Now he is at
Rest. He went out in Justice,
but is returned in Mercy.""
And towards the Conclusion he
called upon the People. to join
with him in an extempore
Prayor. This they did with great
Fervency, which was expressed
not only by repeating it aloud,
but by beating their Breasts,
and clapping their Cheeks and
weeping heartily.To
compleat the Solennity,
immediately after the Delivery
of the Blessing, all on a
Sudden, from the Place near
which the Image stood, there
was heard a most soft and
soothing Symphony of Music,
which being ended the
Assembly broke up, and I
retired to my Lodgings, not a
little affected to see so many
Thousands led away from the
Simplicity of the Gospel, by
such a Mixture of Article and
blind Superstition, of which
indeed I could have formed no
idea, had in not been an Eye-
Witness of it myself.This
Concern was still increased by
what I heard from some of my
fellow Passengers, who
informed me that about Eleven
one Night, after I came on
Board, they not only heard a
Fry preaching most fervently
before the Seigneur, but also
saw several Companies of
Penitents brought in, lashing
and whipping themselves
severely. How little unlike
this to those who cut
themselves with Knives and
Lancets and cried out from
Morning till Night, ""O Ball
bear us.""Methinks I hear you
say, and had I been present, I
should have wished for the
Spirit of an Elijah toHush,
my friendI am content to
guess at the rest till we meet.
In the mean while let us
comfort ourselves with this
Thought that there is a Season
approaching, when the Lord
God of Elijah will himself
come, and destroy this and
every other Species of
Antichrist By the Breath of his
Mouth, and the Brightness of
his Appearing, even by the all
conquering Manifestation of
his eternal Spirit.Whether as
Men, Christians and
Protestants, we have not more
and more Reason to pray Night
and Day for the hastening on
that glorious and long wished
for Period, you will be better
able to judge, when I send you,
(as I purpose to do, if I have
Time) a further Account of a
Lent Procession or two, of
which I was also a Spectator.
At present I can only beg a
continual Remembrance at
Throne of Grace, as being, my

LETTER II.
Lisbon, Marchx 1754
My dear Friend,
THO'some other Business
demands my Attention, yet I
get the Promise made you of a
further Account of the Lisbon,.
Some of those already
mentioned were extraordinary
their great Drought; but that
which is to be the Subject was
an annual one; it being always
customary at Procession or
another every Friday in Lent.
An who stood near me, was so
good as to be my Interp as it
passed alongI say Dumb
Show For chiefly made up of
waxen or wooden images, and
ders through the Streets,
intending to represent the Life
and Death of St. Francis, the
Founder of one of their
religious Orders.They were
brought out from the
Franciscan Convent, and were
preceeded by three persons in
Scarlet Habits with Baskets in
their Hands, in which they
received the Alms of the
Spectators, for the Benefit of
the poor Prisoners.After
these, came two little Boys in
Party Color'd Cloaths, with
Wings fixed on their Shoulders,
in Imitation of little Angles.
Then appeared the Figure of St.
Francis, very gay and Beau-
like, as the used to be before
his Conversion.In the next he
was introduced under
Conviction, and consequently
stript of his Finery.Soon after
this was exhibited an image of
our blessed Lord himself, in a
Purple Gown, with long black
Hair with St. Francislying
before him to receive his
immediate Orders. Then
came the Virgin Mother,
(borresco referens) with Christ
her Son at her left Hard, and St.
Francismaking his Obeysance
to both.Here if I remember
aright, he made his first
Appearance in a Friar's Habit
with his Hair cut short, but not
as yet shaved in the Crown of
his Head. After a little Space
followed a mitred Cardinal
gaudily attired, and before him
lay St. Francis almost
prostrate, in Order to be
confirmed in his Office. 
Soon Oster this he appears
quite metamorphosed into a
Monk, his Crown thorn, his
Habit black, and his Loins girt
with a knotted Cord. Here he
prays to our Saviour hanging
on a Cross, that the Marks of
the Wounds in his Hands, Feet
and Side, might be impressed
on the fame Parts of his Body,
The Prayer is granted: Blood
comes from the Hands, Feet
and Sides; and the Saint with
great Devotion receive the
Impressions. This was
represented by red waxen
Strings, reaching from those
Parts of the Image to the
corresponding Parts of St.
Francis's Body. Upon this he
begins to do Wonders; and
therefore in little while he was
carried along, holding up a
House which was just falling.
This Miracle they say was
performed (if my Information
be true) at Madrid, but the
Particulars of its History I have
forgotten.At length the
Father dies, and is brought
forth lying in the Grave.But
lo! the Briars and Nettles under
which he lay; are turned into
fine and fragrant Flowers. After
this he is born along upon a
Bier covered with a Silver Pall,
and four Friars lamenting over
him.He then appears for the
last Time, but with an Increase
of Power; for he was
represented as drawing
tormented people out of
Purgatory with his knotted
Cord, which as you may well
imagine, the poor Souls
catched at, and took Hold of
very eagerly. At length came
a gorgeous Friar under a
splendid Canopy, bearing in his
Hand a Piece of the Holy
Cross. After him followed two
more little winged Boys, and
then a long Train of fat and
well-favored Franciscans with
their Calceis Fenestratis, as
Erasmus calls them; and so the
Procession ended. Methinks I
hear you say it is full Time.
And so say I For as the Sight
itself disgusted me, so I am
persuaded the bare Narration of
it, though ever so short, cannot
be very peasant to you, who I
know abhor every Thing that
favours of Superstition and
Idolatry. We will therefore take
our Leave of St. Francis,
whose Precession was in the
Day-Time: but I must tell you it
is only to inform you of another
of a much more awful and
shocking Nature, which I saw
afterwards by Night. It was
about Ten o' Clock, when being
deeply engaged in
Conversation with my kind
Host, in came an Englishman
and told me in all Haste he had
seen a Train of near Two
hundred Penitents passing
along, and that in all
Probability I might be gratified
with the same Sight, if I
hastened to a Place whither he
would conduct me. I very
readily obey'd the Summons,
and s Curiosity quickened my
Pace, we soon came up with
some of these poor Creatures,
who were then making a Halt,
and kneeling in the Street,
whilst a Friar from a high Cross
with an Image of our Lord
crucified in his Hand, was
preaching to them, and the
populace, with great
Vehemence. Sermon being
ended, the Penitents, who had
already been preached to, went
forwards, and several
Companies followed after with
their respective preaching
Friars at their Head bearing
Crucifixes. These by pointed to
and brandished frequently, and
the Hearers as frequently beat
their Breasts, and clapp'd their
Checks. At proper pauses they
flopp'd and prayed; and one of
them, more zealous than the
rest, before the King's Palace,
founded out the Word
Penitentia through a speaking
Trumpet. The Penitents
themselves were cloathed and
covered all over with white
Linen Vestments, only Holes
were made for their Eyes to
peep out at. All were
barefooted and all had long
very heavy Chairs fastened to
their Ancles, which, when
dragged along he Street, make
a dismal Rattling: But tho' alike
in Dress, yet in other Respects
there was great Variety
amongst them. For some
carried great Stones on their
Backs, and others dead Men's
Bones and Sculls in their
Hands. Some bore large and
seemingly very heavy Crosses
upon their shoulders, whilst
others had their Arms extended
quite wide, or carried a Bow
full of Swords, with the Points
downwards. Most of them
whipped and lashed
themselves, some with Cords,
and others with flat Bitts of
Iron. It being Moon-shine
Night, I could see them quite
well; and indeed some of them
struck so hard that I perceived
that their Backs (left bare on
Purpose to be flash'd) were
quire red, swoln very much, by
the Violence and Repetition of
Blows. Had my dear Friend
been there, he would have
joined with me in saying that
the whole Scene was horrible.
So horrible, that being it was to
be continued till Morning, I
was glad to return from whence
I came about Midnight. Had
you been with me, I know you
would have joined with me in
praising and gratefully adoring
the Lord of all Lords, not only
for the great Wonder of the
Reformation, but also the
glorious Deliverance wrought
out for us, in stopping of our
late unnatural Rebellion.",nonslave

of the taking of his
majesty's ship the
Warwick by 3 French
men of war, may be
depended upon to be
true in every particular,
and is published to do
justice to Capt.
Shuldham, (whose conduct and
courage has been long ago fully
experienced) as well as to his
officers and men.
On the 11th of March, by break
of day, the Warwick descried 3
fail, to which she immediately
gave chance: Upon coming
near them, they were soon
discovered to be ships of war,
one particularly looming
extremely large: As they did
not answer the Warwick's
signal, she being certain of
their great superiority stood
from them, but in vain; for, as
they were all prime failors they
soon came up with her. The
Atalanta, a frigate of 38 guns
first fired one gun, which the
Warwick returned with a
broadside: Tho' the Atalanta
was at first to wind ward she
soon ranged under the
Warwick's lee quarter, by
which means she avoided her
lower tier, for, upon the
Warwick's running out the
lower docker; the sea rushed in
with such impetuosity, that she
was obliged to close all the
ports before the main-mast:
However, tho' the Warwick
could bring but 6 of her lower
deckers to bear against her, yet,
from the continual fire of the
upper tier, as well as that of the
marines commanded by Capt.
Brough (who all behaved with
the utmost spirit, and could
scarce be prevailed upon to
kneel down) the Atalanta was
obliged to sheer off: The
Prudent of 74 guns and 864
men, (exclusive of a great
number of officers and boys)
was now within gun-shot, with
whom the Warwick exchanged
several broadsides: By this time
the Zephyre also, another ship
of 34 guns was very near; and
the Atalanta had tacked about,
so that in 5 minutes the
Warwick must have been in the
center of 3 fires: This situation
induced the captain to strike,
who thro' a principle of
humanity was unwilling to
sacrifice the lives of to many
brave fellows. There were
killed on board the Atalanta 5
men, and 17 wounded, 4 of
whom died of their wounds in
less than a week, which is a
proof that the Warwick's guns
were better pointed and did
much more execution than
those of the enemy, who have
endeavoured to conceal their
loss.
From the above relation we
must beg leave to observe, that
the scandalous reports, lately
propogated with regard to this
engagement, could come only
from those, who are disaffected
to his majesty's person and
government: From those who
never pay any regard to truth or
merit, when it opposes their
rebellious inclinations: But
being hurried away by a wicked
and jacobitical zeal, take
pleasure in debasing the
characters of the bravest
commanders, and most loyal

strengthening as well as

consider his most faithful
majesty's long dispatch, in
which are contained authentic
testimonies or the Jesuits
having concerted the

deduction of circumstances of

stronger than any testimony;
and lastly the consessions of
some of themselves. Upon
these motives his majesty
declares his intention to abolish
the order, and to banish the
persons of the Jesuits out of his
dominions. The following has been
communicated to us, as an
Account of what we have
hitherto called the Young-Twin's
Plot: It now appears to have
been the Lower-Cherokee's, and
has been revealed by a Creek
Indian, who was present at the
late alarming Interviews with
the Chactaw's. He says, That be
accompanied Nehalacko, a
Headman of the Palachucolas
in the Lower-Creek's, to renew
the Friendship that subsisied
between the two Nations: That
they accordingly arrived at
Keowee the beginning of last
Month: That upon their Arrival
a Council was immediately
called, whereat the Cherokee's
related a long Train of
pretended Griavanes, such as,
the Loss of their People on the
Frontiers of Virginia,
Encroachments on their
Hunting-Grounds, &c. declared
that nothing but the Fear of
drawing the Resentment of the
Creeks upon them, preventing
their taking a Resolution to
break with the English, and
desired to know what Part they
(the Creek's) would take in the
Quarrel; or, if they would agree
to sta Neuter: That Nehalacko
thereupon censured them, as
the sole Authors of the Evils
brought upon them, by
suffering us to build Forts in
their Nation, and being too
familiar with us,&c. and told
them, for his Part, be could not
engage that the Creek Nation
would take any Part in their
War: That the Cherokee's then
insisted he would return with
all possible Expedition to his
Country, to sound the
Dispositions of his
Countrymen; and immediately
after send off two Headmen,
with the Result of that Council;
by which they would regulate
their future Conduct.If this
be true (which we have no
Reason to doubt) it is plain the
Lower-Cherokee's were not
satisfied with the Murders of
the Rowan Settlers, but
intended further Mischief. The
Creek's not having show an
Eagerness to join them, we may
fairly deduce, that the lately
dreaded Indian War is n a fair
Way of being prevented; the
Cherokee's denying the Subject
of their Interview with the
Creek's, and Change of
Conduct since the Mankiller's
Talk to the Lower-Towns, but
more especially since their
receiving his Excellency's Talk,
seem to us clear Proofs of it.
One of the chief Complaints of
the Cherokees, is, that they are
cramped in their Hunting-
Grounds; for which they mush
be allowed to have some
Reason; For, a great Number of
lawless Vagabonds, have for
some Time past obtruded
themselves upon them from
almost every one of the
Northern Colonies, and, being
equally destitute of any good
Principle as of Employ, commit
all kinds of Misdemeanours: To
such Obtruders, it is most
probably owing, that any white
People are scalped, and that we
have any bad Talks, for some of
them are known to have
ingratiated themselves enough
with the Indians to sow
Dissentions among them, and
lay the Faults they commit to
others: We could even name
some, did our Intelligence
amount to positive Proof; and
'till Measures can be fallen
upon to expel these Villains, it
can hardly be expected that
Matters will go altogether well
in the Cherokees",nonslave

Substance of the
Information given us lest
Week by Mr. Thomas
Beamer.
THAT for some time after the
conclusion of the late treaty
with the Charles at fort Prince-
George, he did not observe the
apparent dissatisfaction or ill-
hurnour in any of them; on the
contrary, that they seemed
content, well and remarkably

of to the white people That
on the 12th or 19th of January,
70 or So Cherokees, all of the
Lever-Town (except the Round-
O, then amongst them) who
had assembled at Estates,
headed by the Young-Warrer of
that town, and of K, came,
leading two murderers, whom
they pretended they were going
to deliver up to Mr. Coytmore,
to his father's cow-pen, where
he resided, two miles on this
side Estatee, and desired him to
go with them as their linguist or
interpreter. That they had no
fire-arms whatever with them,
and if they had other weapons
they must have concealed them
under their blankets. That after
he had gone with them some
part of the way, 30 of the party
separated and took a different
route; and he proceeded with
the rest to the fort, where they
arrived at 4 o'clock P.M. That
they acquainted Mr. Coytmore
they came to deliver up two
murderers, and to obtain the
release of two hostages; and
desired they might be admitted
into the fort altogether, to see
their friends, and choose which
of them to release. That Mr.
Coytmore answered, he could
not admit more than 3 or 4 at a
time, and, when that number
went out, as many more, &c.
That thereupon 5 or 6 rushed
into the fort, and the gate was
shut to keep out the rest. That
he heard Mr. Coytmore had
been warned the day before, by
John Houses, and , two traders,
(the lest named of whom was
then in to be on his guard, and
that the to have some
mischievous designs in their
heads, and perhaps would
attempt to surprise the fore.
That he () cannot out with those
that had been admitted, when
the rest pretended that the two
murders had escaped. That he
observed to ill disposition in
the, even after this, nor were
they insolent; and he
immediately went home to his
father's. That two days after, an
Indian boy of Knowce, called
there on his way to Estatee,
dressed in a new blanket, with
a new pair of white men's shoes
on. That he questioned the boy
whither he was going, and
where he got those things. That
the boy answered, he was going
to to fetch some physic for the
warriors, and had got the
blanket, &c. at John store. That
he immediately recollected, it
was usual for the Charles when
they had done mischief, to take
some kind of drug to ease their
minds after it, and conclude the
boy could not come by the
blanket, &c. honesty. That he
thereupon questioned the boy
more closely, whether the
Indians had not murdered , and
plundered his store. That the
boy answered they bad done
both, and killed ten more white
men at his house. That upon
this his father took the alarm,
and was conveyed by him out
of danger, traveling thro
unfrequented places in the
night. That he returned tow
days after to his father's house
to remove his mother, his
sisters, someslaves and goods.
That when he arrived there his
mother * told him, ""That during
his absence she bad seen some
Indians pass thro' the yard all
dressed in new with a scalp
upon a pole, which for judged
to be Elliott's, and one of them
riding upon Elliott's horse, with
his saddle, bridle, and silver ;
but that no Indian but called at
the house: That she bad
however got information of all
the that was done: That the 30
warrior who from the gang
with which he went to fort
Prince George, directly to
Elliott's house (which was
situated about a mile and half
from the fort) where they
immediately butchered the
following persons, John

interpreters at the late treaty;
James May. Thomas Leopard,
William Young, John Bird
(nick-named square eyd Jack)
James Fraser, Patrick
Campbell, Maurice Morris, and
Dick the sailor: That at the
same place they took John
Winborn and Maurice Gwynn:
That they bad also killed a
soldier at a bag-pen about 150
yards from that fort, and
wounded another who escaped
into it; and bad likewise killed
nine white men in other towns;
one of than John Kelly, in the
town of Notally, whom they cut
into quarters, which they stuck
up upon poles."" That he staid at
home two days afterwards,
packing up goods, &c. but all
that time he saw no one Indian.
That the second day, at night,
he brought away his father's
family, salves and goods, the
same way that he had done his
father before; and left them all
safe at Beaver-Creek. That tho
the Round-O was among this
assemblage from the Lower-
towns, he believed that it had
no concern is their hellish plot,
but was ignorant of it, and only
went to see two of his sons,
who by his own offer, were of
the hostages in the fort. That he
would not pretend to say the
defection was general, but
believed it night be so; and that
his brother in saw, the Young-
Warrior of Estatee, was the
ringleader. That 14 Creek
Indians, said to be of
Cussitown, soon after the
governor's departure from fort

publickly in the Lower-Town.

Mortar and his gang were there
too, and might be the
instigators of the defection.
That he heard, a large convoy
of hogs had got safe into fort
Londoun, while the nation kept
up the shew of friendship. And
that his mother informed the
Indians had a camp at about
two miles distance all around

Creek war, at least for some
time, by the arrival yesterday
morning of Mr.Jerome
Courtonne, from the Breed
Camp; who on his way down,
passed near, or came thro' all
the Upper Creek towns, the
beginning of this month; when
all was apparently quiet there,
and he saw the traders in
several of them gathering up
their effects and about their
usual business. He has given us
the following information in
relation to the late outrages
committed there. ""That there
were no more than 11 people
killed in those towns, including
a negro, viz. John Rose, a
trader; William Mitchell, his
Packhorse-man; and Tom, a
negro (Ross's slave) at the
Sugespoga's, where the
mischief was begun by a lad,
son of the headman of that
town, and others associated
with him, who first killed R and
Mitchel, and then the negro.
That the gang encreased here,
and went next to the
Oaksuskees, where they killed
William Rae, a trader, and
William Ro his Packhorseman;
making the Oaksuskee people
believe, that the Headmen of
the Lower-Towns had killed
every white man in them, and
the Sufespoga headmen had
done the same in theirs, as
there could be no possibility of
making up matters again; and
that the warriors were
following them: This infnation
brought more brought more
Indians into their gang, with
whom they went on to
Carolegies, where they
likewise murdered Lachlan
McIntosh, and George Johnson
traders; and John Roberts,
William Franks, and George
McCullough, packhorsemen;
repeating there what they had
told before, and that the Oak
headmen themselves had killed
their own traders: Then they
proceeded to Fu, where they
killed Richard Hughes, a trader,
who is said to have defended
himself gallantly for a long
time with nothing but a carving
knife, and where the murders
ended. That several tracers fied
for protection to the Wolf's
town, who behaved to them all
in the kindest manner; and
caused them to be hid in a
swamp while he sent out
runners to pet intelligence of
the occasion of this alarm, and
arm'd and painted all his
warriors, declaring, that his
attachment to the English was
unalterable, and that he would
defend them to the lost, if even
the whole nation besides had
joined in a conspiracy against
them, and saying that his
bowels were interwoven with
those of the white people
[which shows that we were led
into a mistake (by a letter from
the Creek country) when we
men in this paper, ""that the
Wolf King had proved a
""deceitiul mercenary fellow.""]
The Wolf on got intelligence
how the affair happened,
recalled the hidden traders, and
kept them under his protection,
till the headmen of the nation
were summoned and had a
meeting at Mucculassa; at
which they and the warriors, all
disavowed having any previous
knows ledge of, or consenting
to, the murdering and robbing
of the traders; and resolved that
the living traders should be
protected and their goods
restored, and that the effects
belonging to the stain should be
collected and secured for their
friends: He even sent runners to
recall some traders that had fled
to Pensacola; where naked and
distressed as they were relies
was refused them by
Englishment (who were there in
two vessels from New-York,
and one from Rhode-Island,
trading with a very gay French
gentleman from Mobille) while
even savages (the Tamasee
Indians) took off their shirts
and covered them. That there
had also been a meeting of the
headmen of the lower towns at
the Tallises, who likewise
disavowed their knowledge of,
and assent to, the late outrages
committed (as they say) by
some mad young fellows. That
26 Upper Creeks were gone
with Mr. Joseph Wright, to see
if they could accommodate
matters with governor Ellis at
Savannah, where Mr.
Courtonne supposes they may
be arrived yesterday. That soon
after the assemblies of the
headmen, the traders returned
to their respective towns, to
gather their effects. That the
famous Mortar of Oakeboy was
at last returned to his town,
whom he verlly believes to be
the instigator and some of the
late disturbances. That (besides
the Wolf) the Gun-Merchant
Duvall's-Landwrd, the
Oaksusee captain, the Miser
and the Tallsee headmen, and
saved several white people
from being murdered, exerted
themselves in an extraordinary
manner in our favour, and
prevented the war being made
general; while some other
Indians, who had received
distinguishing favours, were
discovered to be very great
villains. Mr.Courtonne is of
opinion, that, notwithstanding
the friendly professions of most
of the Creek headmen, a
national rupture has been long
since preme-itaed and resolved
on, at the instigation of the
French, by means of their
known agent the Mortar, but
that the breach was not
intended to be begun before the
traders had brought away their
leather and returned with fresh
and large supplies of goods: He
is likewise of opinion, that if
the Creek trade is not stopped,
at least 'till the fall, the French
party in that nation will still
join the Cherokees.",nonslave

I WAS in company the other day with some gentlemen from town, when the discourse turned on the negro bill now on the carpet.I was not surprised at the objections that were made, because the planter and merchant think themselves equally concerned to prevent its going down. Men will always make use of a thousand frivolous excuses, to avoid taking the best measures for securing their property; because the majority will always embrace a present gain, to their future and permanent interest. The legislature will think differently from them: they know, there is hardly a society of men, who do not think the whole prosperity of a nation depends upon their single fate; so that should they at any time be consulted, their answers will be mysterious, partial, and inclining with a strong bias to their own emolument. I am no so old, or so weak, as to suffer myself to be surrounded with fears and suspicions, or startled at distant dangers, yet I think our situation alarming: Heaven knows our military capacity is not very great: and our numbers are so inconsiderable that should a general defection happen, we might easily be served, as Gulliver did geese and turkies when he lived among the Lilliputians. Whenever a Law is to be passed, I taken it but one consideration is to be made, ""whether it will be for the interest of the whole."" Individuals must be thrown aside: for, in applying remedies to the evils of government, some private men must suffer; they who introduce those evils will, and it is intended they should. It is said, that an increase of inhabitants is an addition of strength and riches. Among a free people it is undoubtedly true: but where Slavery is allowed, exceptions are to be made. An increase of negroes adds to the riches of a country, only where they are so employed as to bring in a reasonable profit to the master; otherwise they become a burden: they never can add to the strength of a people, but subject it to perpetual dangers, which will always be greater, according to the disproportion. Now the difference of the number of whites and blacks, and the present situation of our planters, sufficiently evinces, we labour under both these difficulties. The arguments which, as the company informed me, were made use of, against the bill. turn upon the inconveniences that will arise to particulars: many of them are so nearly alike, that in my answer to them, you must not be surprised, if I sometimes am guilty of repetitions, and make use of reasons that carry the same appearance. I could have been less prolix, and much shorter in my remarks: but, as I have the thing at heart, I chose to imitate them in this disuse way; because I know when men are almost determined upon a point, they must have the inconveniences often repeated, in order to deter them from that determination.

1. It will tend towards decreasing our white inhabitants.

The great disproportion between whites and blacks daily increasing when an unlimited importation of negroes is allowed. I am a little surprised that this objection should be started in case a temporary prohibition should take place. It is a misfortune for the province, the people are too much disposed to do every thing by negroes which can be done by them. Private avarice makes us blind to the true interest of our country. Each individual will have tradesmen among his slaves , to the great discouragement of whites of an inferior order, whom of all other men we stand most in need of. Now, if the number of negroes were lessened; if they were not suffered to increase; necessity at length would oblige us to take them for the cultivation of our lands, necessity would oblige us to call in more tradesmen of all kinds; nor would there be any difficulty in inticing them over: there are as many indigent and unemployed hands in England as ever; but the spirit and activity which was once seen among them is loft, because the alluring prospect of an easily livelihood is now no more. No man will deny, that the security and wealth of a nation consists in the number of its middling men of a free condition , and a gradual and imperceptible transition from the highest to the lowest. If this pernicious disposition of importing such quantities of slaves ; if this sordid method of bringing them up to trade of all kinds continues, this gradation will be impossible: in a little time, our province will consist chiefly of a few planters and merchants, subject to the insurrections of salves, because numerous and disaffected.

II. That the possibility of the planter's extricating himself from the debt contracted for negroes, in one or two lucky crops, is a sufficient inducement for purchase frog a greater number.

It is an observation which seldom falls under the eye of the people, but which it is supposed every legislative power is acquainted with, ""that the ignorance, the negligence, the prodigality and unavoidable misfortunes which surround mankind, must always subject the greater part of them to distressing circumstances."" For these reasons, civil societies form laws to lessen those evils which they cannot eradicate. Now, if a spirit of planting, like an epidemical disease, spreads itself all around; surely the wisdom of our senators would deserve the highest applause, should they endeavour to put a stop to it. the mechanic, the little tradesman, sets out with a view of getting a livelihood by his labour; if that is comfortable, he is satisfied: But the merchant, the planter, they have a more extensive prospect, they intend amassing a fortune : The bait is more alluring; their conduct is to be the more narrowly watched. Unless a planter can set out upon his own bottom, the amazing height of interest is such, that he must make sixteen per cent of his money in order to clear eight; and this is what the most sanguine of them cannot expect, tho' thoroughly acquainted with their business. the success of a few plantations can be no objection to what I have advanced, as I talk of the whole body. And when men launch out beyond their fortunes , in affairs that depend upon chance and accidents, as the planter does; they enter upon what is destructive to society, and ought not to be allowed in a well regulated state: the greater part of them must sail, their fall will not be alone, many will be involved with him; for as he finds his fortune decrease, like the spirited gambler upon the brink of destruction, he will venture any sum, if you permit him, upon the single throw of a die, because there is a distant prospect of succeeding; but no wise man will approve of his conduct.

III. That it will be driving our young people out of the country, to places where negroes and lands are cheaper.

The intention of a negro act is, to prevent a growing inconvenience. It is shrewdly suspected the planters have gone more than one step too far, and an attempt is about to be made to prevent others from falling into the same mistake. Human affairs are so complicated, that I believe some ill consequences attend almost every salutary measure of government: and should a few young men of over-heated imaginations, and wild notions of aggrandizing their fortunes elsewhere, be induced to leave the province because such a act does take place; yet a fear of this kind ought not to work upon the mind of any man: his folly would be equal to those, who would prevent an importation of wine, because a few rakes would get drunk with it. Besides. I do not see that this self-transportation of our youth would be the consequence: young fellows of fortune will still find it worth their while to enter into the planting business. But, says the objector, this is suffering a few individuals to monopolize the landed interest. Ne factor ulira crepodam is a maxim. If a considerable sum of money is requisite for any employment, in a country where interest is high, men of small fortunes ought not to think of entering into it. In whatever station of life fortunes have been made, mens eyes have been dazzled with the prospect; they will venture beyond what reason dictates: but it becomes the public to check their impetuosity, and to prevent industry from loading itself beyond what it can bear.

Now when young men of small fortunes see so many difficulties attending the cultivation of lands; when they see the high interest on one side, and the high price of negroes on the other, I do not imagine it follows, that they will leave the province. This is supposing the spirit of planting is an incurable disease, and therefore not to be attempted. Such a support on would be pernicious to the greatest degree. I am rather apt to think, those of a sufficient fortune would enter into the different branches of trade; those who have less, will undoubtedly apply themselves to the lower employments, which we should always endeavour to encourage. Men who live at home in any tolerable degree of affluence, will never leave their friends and families where they are fixed and settled, to go in search of an interest that at best is precarious. The poorer fort, surely will remain where they are, because a pretty large fun being required to set them up as planters it is morally impossible they can borrow that sum in a country where they are strangers. Georgia, it is said, can only rival us in planting; and it is a fact, the rice lands in Georgia are nearly adequate to ours in price; and the price of negroes will always rise, in proportion to that of the land: there then the same inconveniences will attend them.

IV That it will be robbing the province of a considerable duty towards paying of taxes.

I take this objection to be exceeding trifling. In laying duties upon any thing imported into a country, the only consideration that ought to be made is. ""Whether it will be for the advantage of the community."" If it is found that it will, the duty is to be as light as possible; if not, a total prohibition, or an addition that will amount to the same thing, ought to take place. But I cannot see how the public can suffer; for in a country like ours, where the higher rank of men are brought up to no employments, but trade, planting, and the law, no duty will prevent them from purchasing; and the additional sum that is laid upon them, will make amends for the smaller number that will be sold.

V. That it will throw the rubes of the country into the bands of a few, and promote usury.

How an act which is to prevent men from running in debt, and to enable them the sooner to discharge that debt, can promote usury, I cannot conceive. I can easily foresee, if negroes are to be brought into the country upon the tooting they now are, an usury (if I may so call it) of the most dangerous consequence would ensue. It is the interest of the planter to steer clear from the clutches of the merchant: if he once involves himself there, he is hampered: he can no longer demand an equal consideration for his rice, but must be reduced to the necessity of taking whatever the merchant offers, in order to discharge the debt he owes him: if he refuses, his ruin in inevitable; his negroes and plantation are sized; his scheme of making his fortune is overturned; and that bubble, which he has taken so much pains to blow up, will now be broke. This is far from being a chimera: the principles of trade are not very generous. We know that all bodies of men act upon interested movies; and the welfare of the little society to which they belong taken entire possession of their thoughts. A combination so backed by interest, is to be feared with the greatest reason. Experience tells us, it was so in this very province not long ago: and the planter, after labouring for some time under these very disadvantages, with the greatest good fortune, emerged from the difficulties that were likely to overwhelm him.

VI. That it cannot be said the planter runs in debt, as the negro is an equivalent.

At the time of the purchase no doubt he is; but unless the profits of planting exceed the interest of money, his fortune must decline: the incertainty of life, diseases, the hardship of labour, and the gradual decay of nature, perpetually lessens the principal (for so I call slaves ) of the planters: and were it not clear, their debts were increasing to a prodigious degree, an attempt for a law of this kind would never have been undertaken, however salutary it might be, not only for the interest by the safety of the province.

VII. That it will be the making of Georgia, to our destruction.

If that province was subject to a foreign power; if they could get the materials fro the cultivation of lands cheaper; if the interest of money was lower than with us; if their industry was greater; then we might entertain apprehensions of danger: but when we reflect the same ships which we have, must supply them; when we reflect they must have recourse to the same markets, for things they stand in need of, and at the same price; when we consider they are less capable of giving that price, because they have less money; when we consider, the negro merchant cannot afford to sell Irish negroes for less than he does to us and unless we make this supposition, we must acknowledge ourselves to be vilely imposed upon) these notions are vain, and not to be regarded. The time which is allotted for the continuance of the act is so short, they can make no progress before we shall be upon the footing we now are; and this I think will prevent any man in his senses from deserting his country; and projectors and madmen we ought to be glad to get rid of.

VIII. That it is ingratitude to our mother-country.

There are a sufficient number of markets in America, equally good, to take off all the salves exported from Africa. wherever they are sold, they must be supported and maintained. Neither ther negro merchant, the shipping, or the manufactures of Great-Britain, would suffer from a total prohibition; from a temporary one of two or three years: it is unworthy their notice: But the good of one of his majesty's most flourishing provinces, is to be regarded before the trifling advantage of a private set of men; for, if we compare their profits in this place, to what will redound to Great-Britain from the affluence of the province itself, it will be trifling. We are so restrained by the act of navigation, and other subsequent acts of parliament, that it is impossible we should thrive, without our mother-country finding it turn to her account. They who make use of this argument, must be interested in the negro trade: If they will have a regard for our common parent, let them encourage an increase of whites; for it is indisputably true, that one white-man will take off more of English manufacture than four negroes. These gentlemen seem to justly an observation of my lord Bacon's, ""that there are a race of men in the world, who would willingly and readily set fire to their neighbour's house, for the insignificant advantage of roasting their own eggs at it.""",blackUnrest

Gentlemen of the council, Mr.
speaker, and gentleman of the
assembly,
IT is with uncommon
satisfaction I come this day to
acquaint you with the signal
success of his majesty's forces,
under the command of the east
of Albemarle and Sir George
Pocock, in the reduction of the
city of the Havanna and its
dependencies, an event which
reflects the highest lustre on the
British arms, and stands among
the foremost of those great
achievements which have so
eminently distinguished his
majesty's auspicious reign, and
that of our late victorious
sovereign. While you
participate in the general joy,
which must sill the hearts of all
his majesty's good subject on
this happy occasion, you may
justly feel a particular pleasure
in the reflection that you
readily contributed that
proportion of your property
which the king was pleased to
ask of you, towards the
execution of the very important
service which is now so
prosperously and gloriously
accomplished.
Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen of
the assembly,
It is with much concern I must
observe to you, that the monies
you grant are so slowly brought
into the treasury by the present
mode of collection, that the
credit of the country is much
weakened and the demands of
individuals for all public
service are greatly enhanced
thereby. I have only the
ordinary supplies for the year
to of you, except such an and as
shall be found necessary for the
fortifications, of which I have
ordered the engineer to prepare
an estimate that shall be laid
before you.
Gentlemen of the council, Mr.
speaker and gentlemen so; be
assembly,
I doubt not you will make the
public good the great object of
all your deliberation; and on
my port, I shall gladly concur
with you in your endeavour to
promote it, and assent to such
laws as shall be for his
majesty's service and the
interest of this island.

Assembly,
May it please your excellency,

and loyal subject, the assembly

excellency our thanks for your
speech at the opening of this
session.
This signal success of his
majesty in the reduction of the
important of the and its
dependencies, fill our hearts
with the warmest sense of joy;
every good subject of his
majesty must un rejoice at as
which so high a on the british

glory of his majesty's must
auspicious an additional
pleasure in the consideration;
that amidst the general meal to
give success to that expedition,
those we have the honour to
represent, that suffering under
the in which two intestine
rebellions of their slaves had
lately involved them, were
among the foremost of their
fellow subjects is the
manifestation of their duty and
affection for his majesty, by
raising as expeditiously and
chearfully, as they had
unenimously granted, that
assistance, for this important
service, which had been
required of them by the greatest
and best beloved of kings.
We are truly concerned, that the
monies granted for the support
of his majesty's government of
this island, have been brought
so slowly into the treasury; we
are sally sensible of the
inconvenience that must arise
form thence to the public
credit, and we shall apply our
serious attention to remedy this
evil, altho' we hear the cause of
it in great measure arises from
the scarcity of current coin, and
the high taxes we have
laboured under; we shall
cheerfully raise the necessary
supplies for the ensuing year,
and grant such a sum for the
fortifications of this island, as
the distressed state of the
country will permit.
We should be wanting to
ourselves and our constituents,
if we did not express the
warmest gratitude, for the
assurances from your
excellency, of your concurrence
with our endeavours to promote
the public good; the experience
we have already had of your
excellency's disposition to that
great and, will animate our
deliberations, and we shall feel
abundant satisfaction, if by the
result of them, the
administration of him majesty's

rendered easy, honourable and
happy.

To the PRINTER.
SIR,
THE ministerial advocates are
come at last to own, that vex
populist vex Dei: Not long ago
the people were an unthinking
rabble, to whom no regard was
to be paid: At present they
leave no stone unturned to get
the multitude on their side. I
should have suffered them
quietly to have gone on, did I
not see the gross reasons and
misrepresentations of facts,
they daily obtrude on the
public. With astonishment I see
them endeavour to persuade my
countrymen, that Me. W. by
asserting the privilege of
Parliament, has introduced a
precedent to destroy their
liberties.I would ask those
assertors of the liberty of the
people, if a member of
parliament, besides being
responsible to his constituents,
is not likewise responsible to
his fellow-members, as far as
his conduct affects them; and
moreover, if any man is
culpable for insisting upon his
rights, at any time when
nobody is hurt by such
conduct? Did ever the
parliament empower Mr.W. to
give away their rights, or
introduce a precedent to wave
their privileges? Where then is
the harm in Mr. W's insisting
on what has, in a judicial
manner, been declared to be the
privilege of every member of
parliament? By the be, it shews
a distrust of their cause, and
contempt of the judges of the
land, to oppose the private
opinion of any lawyer, however
learned or dignised, to the
public decision of a court. The
rebel Score lords (who by the
bye were no more than simple
commoners on this side the
Tweed) taken in arms against
their sovereign, were allowed
the liberty of being tried by
English peers at a great
expence to the nation, though
the excellent prince, who
defeated their wicked schemes,
might with the strictest justice
have refused them quarter: And
shall an Englishman grudge a
similar privilege to a member
of parliament, the supposed
author of a supposed libel?
when my countrymen are afraid
to trust the decision of any
cause, but especially a cause of
which they alone have a right
to take cognizance, to their
representatives in parliament;
alas! my country!
But in order to render the
parliament still more odious to
the people, we are presented
with a long catalogue of crimes
which, they say, members of
parliament and their dependents
may commit with impunity.
The silence on this head, every
since the first appearance of
this catalogue, must be owing
either to the deserved contempt
with which the public have
treated this insult upon truth
and common sense; or, as an
ingenious writer observed,.
""We are endowed with faculties
to see through ordinary sullied,
while great absurdities strike
with an astonishment which
over comes the powers of
reason, and makes
improbability even an
additional motive to belief.""
Pitiable indeed would out case
be, were this representation
just: But be of good comfort,
my countrymen; the privilege
of parliament protects no man
in the commission of any
crime; it only reserve to the
parliament the power of taking
cognizance of the crimes
committed by members:
Judge not therefore rashly,
whatever others of either may
have done: Presume not to
decide causes where ye have no
right: Avoid by all means every
thing tending to weaken any
part of the constitution: All
attempts to this purpose will be
fruitless as they are weak; for
be assured, it is a cock against

not prevail.",nonslave

CATHARINA II. By the grace

inaketh known by these
presents to all to whom it
appertains: ""When, by the will
of God, and agreeable to the
unanimous wishes of all our
faithful subjects, we mounted
the Throne of Russia, we were
not ignorant that Prince John,
born on the marriage of Prince
Anthony Brunswick
Wolfenbuttle, with the Princess
Anne of Mecklenbourg, was
still alive. That Prince, as all
the world knows, was no
sooner born than he was
illegally appointed to wear the
Imperial Crown of Russia: But
by the decrees of Providence,
he was in a short time after
excluded for ever, and the
reverted to the lawful heir,
daughter of Peter the Great, our
most dear aunt of glorious
memory.
""Our first cares, on our
accession to the Throne, after
having rendered our
thanksgiving to Heaven, were,
through an effect of the
humanity, which is natural to
us, to make as easy as possible
the sate of that Prince,
dethroned by the divine will,
and unhappy from his infancy.
We propose immediately to see
him ourselves, to judge of the
faculties of his mind, and to
procure him, suitable to his
character and the education
which he had hitherto received,
a tranquil and comfortable life.
But what was our surprise to
find, that besides a stammering
incommodious to himself, and
nearly incomprehensible to
others, he was absolutely
deprived of sense and reason.
All those who were then with
us, saw how much our heart
suffered at the fight of an
object so proper to excite our
compassion; and they were at
the same time convinced, there
remained nothing for us to do
for that Prince, born so
unhappily, but to leave him
where he was, and to procure
him all the indulgences suitable
to his situation. We gave our
orders in consequence, tho' his
condition did not permit him to
be sensible of it, not knowing
any body, nor being able to
distinguish good from evil, nor
to make use of books to pass
away the rime; placing, on the
contrary, all his falicity in
things which shewed the
disorder of his imagination.
""To prevent, therefore, any
attempts of evil-minded
persons, from particular views,
to interrupt, in any manner
whatever, or to make use of his
person to trouble the public
repose; we ordered him a sure
guard, and placed over him two
honest and faithful officers of
the garrison. These were Capt.
Walssioff and Lieut. Tichekin,
who, by their long services in
the military, where their health
had greatly suffered, merited
recompence, and an easy
employ for the remainder of
their days. It was recommended
to those two officers to take all
imaginable care of his person.
""However, not with standing all
these precautions, it was
impossible to prevent a villain,
thro' a most unnatural, wicked
propensity, and in contempt
even of his own life, from
committing at Schtussenbourg
a deed, the thought of which
alone strikes a terror. A Sub-
Lieutenant of the regiment of
Smolensko infantry, an
Ukrainian by birth, named
Bassle Mirowitz, grand-son of
the first Rebel who followed
Mazeppa, and to whom perjury
was transmitted by blood, as
appears, having passed his life
in debauchery, dissipation, and
disorder, and being thereby
deprived of the means of
making an honourable fortune;
having at length lost fight of
what he owed to the law of
God, and the oath of fidelity he
had taken to us, not knowing
Prince John but by name, and
still much less the qualities of
his body and mind, took it into
his head, to attempt to make, by
his means, a shining fortune at
whatever price, and however
bloody the scene might prove
to the public.
""For the execution of this
project, so detestable and
dangerous for the country, and
desperate for himself, he
demanded, during our journey
into Livonia, that he might be
sent, tho' it was not his turn, to
form the guard, which is
relieved every eight days, in the
fortress Schlussenbourg; and in
the night between the 4th and
5th of last month, at two hours
after mid-night, he suddenly
awake his grand guard, ranged
them, in front, and ordered
them to charge with ball.
Barednicoff, commandant of
the fortress, having heard a
sailed out of his quarter, and
demanded the reason of
Mirowitz himself; but all the
answer he got from that Rebel
was a blow from the butt-end
of his musket on his head,
which wounded and stunned
him. After this he seriously led
his tropp to attack and fire on
the few soldiers who guarded
Prince John; but the latter who
were formed under the orders
of the two officers before-
named, received him in such a
manner that he was obliged to
retire. By a particular direction
of Providence, who watches
over the lives of men, there that
might a very thick fog, which
joined to the interior situation
of the fortress, occasioned as
person to be killed or wounded.
""The ill-success of this first
attempt could not make this
enemy of the public repose
from his project or rebellion;
suggested to him the bringing
form a a peace of cannon with
the necessary am he
accomplished, Capt. Walf and
Lieut. Tichokin, seeing a force
which they could not and a
misfortune much greater, if the
to them was delivered up, by
the innocent blood which it
would cost the country in such
trouble; they both resolved on
the only step which they
thought remained, that is to say,
to secure the public tranquility
by abridging the days of the
unfortunate Prince.
Considering, besides this, that
if they let a prisoner escape in
such a manner, they should rise
being punished according to all
the rigour of the laws, they
took away the life of the
Prince, without being descried
by the fear of receiving death
from the hand of a villain drove
to desperation. This monster,
seeing before him the body of a
lifeless Prince, was so struck
with the unexpected blow, that
he immediately acknowledged
his rashness and his crime, and
discovered his repentance to his
troop, which but an hour before
he had reduced, and made
accomplices of his villainy.
""It was then that the officers,
who had stifled this revolt in its
burn, conjointly with the
commandant, secured the rebel,
brought back the soldiers to
their duty, and sent to the privy
Councellor and Senator Panin
(under whose orders they are)
the report of this event, which,
though unhappy, may, by-the
protection of Heaven have
prevented a much greater
misfortune.
""The Senator immediately sent
Lieut. Caschken with sufficient
instructions to secure
tranquility and good order on
the spot, and at the same time
dispatched a courier to us with
the detail of this affair, in
consequence of which, we
ordered our Lieutenant-General
Weymarn, of the division of St.
Petersbourgh to repair to the
place, and to get the necessary
informations, which being
finished, he has just remitted to
us the interrogatories, the
depositions of the witnesses,
the convictions and the villian's
own confession.
""Having acknowledged the
greatness of this crime, and
how much it concerns the
repose of the whole country, we
have laid the whole affair
before our Senate, and ordered
them, in conjunction with the
Synod, to invite the three first
classes and the President, of all
the Colleges, to hear the report
from the mouth of Lieutenant-
General Weymarn, who has
gone through the imformations;
afterwards to pronounce
sentence according to the laws
of the Empire; and, when it is
signed, to present it to us for
our confirmation.""

the Press is so essential to the
support of our mixed
government; this sufficiently
decides that second question,
Whether this Liberty be
advantageous or prejudicial?
there being nothing of greater
importance in every state than
the preservation of the ancient
government, especially if it be
a free one. But I fain would go
a step farther, and allies, that
such a liberty is attended with
so few inconveniencies, that it
may be claimed as the common
right of mankind, and ought to
be indulged them almost in
every government, except the
ecclestastical, to which in
would prove fatal. We need not
dread from this liberty any such
will consequences as followed
from the harangues of the
popular demagogues of Athens
and tribunes of Rome. A man
reads a news paper alone and
coolly. There is none present
from whom he can catch the
passion by contagion. He is not
hurried away by the force and
energy of action. And should he
be wrought up to ever so
seditious a humour, there is no
violent resolution presented to
him by which he can
immediately vent his passion.
The liberty of the Press,
therefore, however abused, can
scarce ever excite popular
tumults or rebellion. And as to
these murmurs of secret
discontents it may occasion, it
is better they should get vent in
words, that they may come to
the knowledge of the
magistrate before it be too late,
in order to his providing a
remedy against them. Mankind,
it is true, have always a greater
profession to believe a hat is
said to the disadvantage of their
governors, than the contrary;
but this inclination is
inseparable from them, whether
they have liberty or not. A

be as pernicious as a pamphlet.

The CRISIS; or, a full
defence of the colonies.
In which it is contestibly
proved that the British
constitution has-been
flagrantly violated in the
late STAMP ACT.
THE main argument which the
enemies of the colonies make
use of to justify the act of
Parliament in dispute is that the
British legislature has an
undoubted right of establishing
whatever ordinances it proper
for the regulation of all the
British and that it is an absolute
rebellion against the brity of
the Mother Country for any
part of those dominions to
refuse an implicit obedience to
such ordinances. To this the
Americans reply that as they
are utterly unrepresented in the
Parliament of the Mother
country, a doctrine of this kind
must inevitably rob them of the
most valuable rights which they
ought to possess, as
Englishmen, and reduce them
in an instant, from a nation of
free born subjects, to a set of
the most miserable slaves. Such
is the state of the present
question.
That the Mother Country has
power of imposing what
burthens she thinks proper on
any part of her dominions is a
position so evident that it
cannot possibly admit of a
debate. While she possesses a
force capable of exacting an
obedience to her laws. She
must naturally most agreeable
to her inclination; but it does
not follow, because she is
invested with a power, that she
is invested with right: Nothing
can give a right which is
repugnant to the principles of
equity.",nonslave

the House; and they were
accordingly laid on the table.
Then a motion was made that
they should be printed: This
occasioned many speeches,
desiring that the names of the
Governours and others might
not be printed, nor the places
from whence dated; for that
such persons would fall under
the resentment of the
Americans, and perhaps their
lives and properties might been
dangered: That some
Governours were dependent on
the people for their salaries,
which they might be deprived
of for giving such advice here;
for it seems some of them have
wrote very severe letters
against the colonies. Mr.

others, opposed the suppression
of any names, and were for
having the whole printed,

able, and would defend such
Governours, and others, for
being loyal subjects, and doing

by the great and immortal Pitt,
in a speech, wherein he even
exceeded himself. Persuasion
flowed from his tongue, and
conviction of the truth of his
arguments seemed to tread
close upon it. He began by
declaring that at his coming
into the House he did not
intend to say what he now
found himself obliged to utter,
designing to reserve his opinion
until the grand question came
to be discussed on a future day;
but that as an opportunity now
offered, he was glad of the
occasion of delivering his
opinion to the House,
especially as his infirm state of
health rendered it impossible
for him to promise that he
should be able to attend at a
future day; that he was happy
to demand their attention to
what he might offer in favour
of an injured and oppressed
people. He then proceeded to
declare that he thought the tax
illegal, unjust, unfair, and
impolitick, Illegal, because the
people on whom it was laid
could give no assent to it, as
they were not represented in
Parliament. Impolitick, to lay
burthens upon a people from
whom the greatest advantages
are derived to the other
Country; and whose returns
from thence, in the course of ,
have amounted, annually, to
two millions sterling;
advantage not derived from
commerce with any other part
obe. (He he recapitulated the
conduct of the Minister to
America, during several reigns)
And the loss is to be
compensated, by what? By
perhaps fifty thousand pounds
returned annually into the
Exchequer, and obtained,
possibly, by the destruction of
thousands of brave men, and
good subjects. This said he, is a
stroke of policy, founded on the
same grovelling fordid motives,
which ever distinguished that
Gentleman's (pointing to G. G.)
administration. He observed, in
answer to the common
objection of the colonies
contributing towards the
expense incurred in their
defence, that Great Britain had
surely more in view than a
generous motive when she
undertook their defence; that
she had the strongest regard to
her own safety, in the
preservation and enlargement
of her trade and territories. ",nonslave

Extract of a letter from
London, March 1.
MONDAY last the Chairman of
the Grand Committee on the
American Stamp Act (Mr F-ll-
r) reported to a great House the
resolutions to which the
Committee had agreed; they are
in substance as follow:
1. That it is the opinion of the
Committee that his Majesty,
with the advice of Parliament,
has full power and authority to
made laws and statutes of
sufficient force and validity to
bind the colonies and people of
North America.
2. That insurrections and
tumults of the most dangerous
that are have been raised and
carried on in several of the
North American colonies, in
open defiance of the power and
dignity of his Majesty's
government, and in manifest
violation of the laws and
legislative authority of this
kingdom.
3. That the said insurrections
have been greatly countenanced
and inflamed by votes and
resolutions passed in several of
the Assemblies of the said
provinces, highly injurious to
the honour of his Majesty's
government, and tending to
destroy the legal and
constitutional dependence of
said colonies on the Imperial
Crown and Parliament of Great
Britain.
4. That such persons who have
suffered any injury or damage
by manifesting a desire to
comply with and assist in
carrying into execution any acts
to the British Legislature,
relating to the American
colonies, ought to have full and
ample compensation made
them for that same, by the
respective colonies where such
damages were sustained.
5. That all persons who have
manifested their desire to
comply with, and assist in
carrying into execution such
laws, have acted as dutiful and
loyal subjects, and are therefore
entitled to, and will assuredly
have, the protections of the H.
of C. of G. Britain.
6. That all persons who, by
reason of the tumults and
outrages, have not been able to
procure stamp paper, ought to
be indemnified from all
penalties and forfeitures which
they may have incurred by
writing on paper, vellum, &c.
not duly stamped, conformable
to said act.
7. That it is the opinion of the
Committee that the House be
moved for leave to bring in a
bill appeal an act passed last
session, entitled ""An act for
granting and applying certain
stamp duties, and other duties,
in the British colonies and
plantation in America, towards
further defraying the expenses
of defending, protecting, and
securing the same; and for
amending such parts of the
several acts of Parliament,
relating to the trade and
revenues of the said colonies
and plantation, as direct the
manner of determining and
recovering the penalties and
forfeitures therein contained.",nonslave

warrant of the sheriff,
committed to the Tolbooth in

concerned in the late rebellion
was confined in Edinburgh
castle, and broke his neck in
making his escape over the
embrasures facing Livingston's

prisoner at Carlisle, and
suffered an ignominious death
with the rebels there; and his

Dicere verum quid vetat.
AT a time when the hearts of
the people are intoxicated with
joy, for our happy deliverance
from the apprehensions of
oppression and slavery, it may
be supposed a little
extraordinary any steps should
be taken, which might seem to
have a tendency to destroy that
harmony, which ought to, and
which we hope will, subsist
among the different people who
make up our little society.
However illiberal it might be,
to reflect upon any particular
set of men, on account of birth
or country, which are matters of
no consequence; for, in this
respect a Hotteniot, with all his
filth about him, is upon a
footing with the proudest
nation in the universe; yet
resentment becomes every
honest breast for it juries
received; nor is it possible to
conceive, how a proper regard
can be paid to virtue, unless we
feel the warmest indignation
for those dirty prejudices we
daily see in life, and which tend
to stigmatize the characters of
the innocent.Pudei hcop
probria nobis.
If a number of men from any
part of the globe to whom
fortune hath not been
remarkably lavish of her
favours, whom hath not made
superior to the rest of creatures,
in the abilities of heat or should
they, like the wandering Jews
seek a land flowing with milk
and honey, whoever it is to be
found, and, like the Jews,
harbour the greatest contempt
for the simple inhabitations
who possess it; should they be
too proud to admit of any
equality with themselves, yet
humble enough, when interest
directs, to mingle with men
whom they affect to despise; if
their reflections are cruel and
unjust, to a people who have
hitherto treated them with
civility, and received them as
fellow-subject; if their whole
conduct in life is suspicious,
partial and can they be
surprised, if we should at
length see through them, and
view them in that light in which
they have viewed others, and
receive to deal with them only
just as they have dealt with
others? Does not common
sense, common justice, and
even our common safety, press
such a return as absolutely
necessary?
When the different colonies
had taken the constitutional
method of seeking redress of
the injuries they were about to
receive from the Stamp-Act;
when their petitions were
rejected, and the act was upon
the point of being executed; the
people, who had trusted to their
representatives while there was
a possibility of their being of
service, then took the alarm;
were enraged at a treatment
they never deserved; and,
terrified at the prospect of
future slavery, prevented the
officers from enforcing the act.
This was termed
RESOLUTION. This
appellation was given to it, by
a sett of men who certainly
ought to know what rebellion
is, far better than any other of
his Majesty's subjects: They
have been guilty of the crime;
they have felt the chastisement
it deserves. Some old stagers
compared the congress to the
meeting of the Clous in 15 and
45: Take the PRINCIPLES of
each, and judge if the
comparison is just.
The SCOTCH had been
amongst the most violence in
the expulsion of the Stuarts;
they rejoiced at the revolution;
they were incorporated in
Queen Anne's reign, and were
content (God bless them) to
become Englishmen: On a
sudden, they took up arms to
dethrone Majesty, to place the
crown on the supposed
offspring of that family they
had rejected; endeavoured to
overturn the constitution, to
establish a government
destructive of the natural rights
of man and of that government,
ditch is a disgrace to the deity.
This was Resolution indeed? a
Rebellion against God and
man!
The AMERICANS brought
charities, granted by royalty
itself, along with them, in
whatever colony they settle; the
common law attended them;
right of Englishmen were
expressed in their chatters; they
confidence themselves, and
were considered, as entitled to
such rights; they have for a
century enjoyed them, without
interruption: Their loyalty has
been as unshaken as the guards
of his Majesty's most sacred
person; the same lips which in
peace the authors of their
wrongs, spoke with reverence
of Him.
At length a bill, through many
whimsical events, had found its
way through both houses, and
was passed into a law: A bill
which deprived them of the
protection of law, and totally
destroyed these lights which
distinguishes them from the
slaves they command. The
nearest freeholders knew, they
were represented in their own
colonies, by those whom
themselves had effected; not
could they have least
conception of any other
representation: They knew it
was the birthright of
Englishmen; it was their
birthright; it was their best,
their only, security. Many
among them had a more
extensive idea of the
constitution; they knew it was
not in their power to yield up
the rights, which their children
were equally entitled to: They
knew, they could not forfeit
them without committing
certain crimes; they had
committed none; no crimes
were laid to their charge; they
know, in every free
constitution, let the form of
government be what it would,
resistance was sometimes laun
They knew the revolution was
brought about the principles of
resistance; that it could be just
fled from no other principles;
and to these principle they were
indebted for the present royal
They bought resistance in them
was a virtue, because the two
blessings, for the sole
protection of which men enter
into society, their liberty and
their property, were at stake:
They knew the power of them
mother country; and had she
her force, their ruin would have
been inevitable; but through the
honest impressions of
education, and notions derived
from old story-books, whipt
into them when they were boys
perhaps, they thought it more
generous to perish, in that ruin,
than to have lived to see their
offspring subject to the daring
insults of every son of Mars, or
to behold their country reduced
to that desart which their
fathers found it. The SCOTCH
endeavoured to introduce a
despotio government in church
and state. We, like the Barons
of old; cried out, ""Nolumas
leges Angl mutari:"" If this be
REBELLION, we are slaves
indeed.
As to the irregularities of the
people, they were to be
lamented; but he who implicitly
condemns, known as little of
man as of government. The
multitude never leave their
occupations to turn politicians,
but when they feel oppression:
Actuated by those passions
which nature has given them,
directed solely by what they
suffer, they will fly from one
extreme to the other, and be
violent in their friendships, or
implacable in their resentment:
And if they were sometimes
hurried too for, let it be
remembered, their anger was
perpetually fed by the idlest
reports; and others, through the
meanest of passions, (their
avarice) were undermining
their worthy intentions, by
every invention that could be
thought of. The torrent could
not have been stopt, but it
might have been diverted, so as
to prove altogether harmless. If
those who were more interested
as they had more to lose, had
mingled with the croud, and
assisted them with their advice,
the people might have been
brought to submit to any thing,
but admitting the act.
I know not for what reason, but
the minds of the freeholders
were inflamed at the last
election, by many a hearty
damn to be ove bottles, bowls
and glasses: A violent
opposition succeeded; and the
richer folks were terrified at a
spirit which themselves had
conjured up; but instead of
endeavouring to reduce the
they had kindled, like the
sluggish tortoise, they shrunk
within their own shells at every
supposed danger. If adversity
drags out EVERY lurking
virtue from the breast (good
God!) what a country do we
live in.
However, we ALL meant, it
now seems, equally well,
though we did not mean to run
the same risk; and when the
news of our deliverance from
impending bondage arrived, we
ALL rejoiced. Of all God's
creatures, Man is the most
inaccountable; his ways are
unsearchable for wisdom, and
there is no finding out his
understanding. They who had
accused us of Rebellion
rejoiced most (outwardly I
mean); like good Christians
they let their light. SO shine
before men, that they might
SEE thing works: They stuck
up tallow in their windows, and
shewed their zeal for Liberty at
the expence of a few farthing
candles. Strange! That they
should light their houses for the
success of REBELLION! and
that a second night too, which
we all now know was entirely
occasioned by them.
Happy, thrice happy race of
men? whose frames are so
peculiarly adapted to the
different circumstances of life,
that, let whatever side prevail,
you can lift up your hands and
join your joyful voices. Had
America bled at every pore, for
crimes she never committed,
for crimes which all her sons
abhor, you might have stood
aloof and enjoyed your posts.
Had her towns been fired, like
another Nero, you might have
played on your instruments,
and sung Te Deum at the
conflagration. But when one
good, one great, one wise man's
influence had saved us from
impending ruin, like to
converted Paul, when the scales
were dropt from his eyes, the
truth beamed forth in all her
native beauty, and persecution
becomes abominable.
I shall take my leave with a
well known story. Archbishop
Sharp had been a staunch whig
in the earlier part of his life,
and when it suited; became a
story in the reign of Queen
Anne: At length he found they
intended to introduce the
PRETENDER, and he trembled
for his dignities in the church;
away he goes, commissioned
by his brethern the good
bishops, to the Earl of
Wharton, who headed the
whigs, and informed his
lordship, he was very sorry
they had so long been of
different sides, altho' he was
sure they had the same
meaning in what they did; that
the had found out the wicked
intentions of the tories, and was
not come to offer him the
service of the lords spiritual.
His lordship replied, he was
very glad to find they were
convinced of their error; but
before he would enter into any
business, begged leave to
mention a little domestick
affair that had just happened:
My Lord, I am an old
sportsman; I love does, and am
very careful in breeding them;
the other day I had a litter from
the breed of my old master
King William, whom you know,
I admired in the choice of all
his, creatures; I waited the
usual time, in expectation of
their opening their eyes, and it
was a matter of amazement
they continued so long blind, as
they had a good dam and an
excellent fuckler; thus
disappointed day after day, and
week after week, I grew angry,
and ordered the huntsman to
throw them into the river; and
what do you think, my lord!

drowning, they all their eyes.",nonslave

A VERY cutting memorial has

The Dutch, if the information

Marquis of Rockingham, be
true, have nearly 50,000,000 l.
slerling in our funds, the annual
interest of this sum cannot be
much less than 2,000,000l. Our
East India Company, supposing
they fit out no more than
twenty ships yearly, and that
each ship, upon an average,
exports forty thousand pounds
in coined money and bullion,
must necessarily carry out of
this kingdom 800,000l.
annually not is this estimate
exaggerated, as plainly appears
by the exports of that Company
last year, which amounted in
gold to forty three thousand
one hundred and ninety six
pounds sterling, and in silver to
seven hundred eighty five
thousand two hundred and
three pounds. These two
exorbitant drains of cash,
investigated through their
various operations, will be
found to be the efficient causes
of the exorbitant price with
every species of provisions

not remedied, may, in time,
produce a general insurrection

To the PRINTERS.
HOWEVER little some may
think of common newspapers,
to a wise man they appear the
Ark of God for the safety of the
people. Their fullness of
general entertainment, small
bulk, and price, recommend
them to every one; and the
variety of the matters, with the
great importance of many of
them, awaken the minds of
many to a solid inquiry of
interests they would otherwise
never once dream of. Never
was a time when greater ence
was necessary to render these
batteries respectable: Press,
and the maintainers of its
freedom, are be obnoxious to
the Gentlemen of High Fortune,
measure will be left untried to
crush the seditious disturbers
of the publick tranquillity;
rebellion, treason, heresy, and
pretence, if there is but power.
There are but two methods of
government, leading and
driving: Nothing will lead the
people but a conviction that
their safety and interests are
the concern of their rulers; and
when the arguments used on
the side of power sail to evince
these points, then may we
expect to hear of racks and
gibbets, and inquisitions in
plenty, and the most worthy
members of the community
deprived of their places of
power to guard the rights of the
people. Assemblies, and right
of trial by juries, must be
undermined by degrees, but
hastened as much as possible,
left a new Administration
should be forced in by a
desperate people, before things
can be thoroughly established.
A man must be slow of
understanding, indeed, to be at
any loss for the tendency of
present measures. Dominica is
taxed by Prerogative alone,
without pretence of Parliament;
and what is the difference in the
condition of the whole
continent, besides the pretence?

I will maintain it to my last
hour,taxation and
representation are inseparable;
this position is founded on
the laws of nature; for whatever
is a man's own is absolutely his
own; so man has a right to take
it from him without his content,
either expressed by himself or
representative; whoever
attempts to do it attempts an
injury; whoever does it,
commits a robbery; he throws
down and destroys the
destination between liberty and
slavery. Taxation and
representation are cocval with
and essential to this
constitution. I wish the maxim
of Machiavel was followed,
that of examining a constitution
at certain periods, according to
its first principles; this world
correct abuses, and supply
defects. I wish the times would
bear it, and that mens minds
were cool enough to enter upon
such a talk, and that the
representative authority of this
kingdom was more equally
settled. I am sure some
histories, of late published,
have done great mischief; to
endeavour to fix the ra when
the House of Cs began in this
kingdom, is a most pernicious
and destructive attempt; to fix
it in an Edward 's or Henry 's
reign, is owing to the idle
dreams of some whimsical ill-
judging antiquarians: But,
, this is a point too important
to be left to such wrong-headed
people. When did the Hof C
s first begin? when, ? it
began with the constitution, it
grew up with the constitution;
there is not a blade of grass
growing in the most obscure
corner of this kingdom, which
is not, which was not ever
represented since the
constitution began; there is not
a blade of grass, which, when
taxed, was not taxed by the
consent of the proprietor. There
is a history written by one
Carte, a history that most
people now see through; and
there is another favourite
history, much read and
admired. I will not name the
author. Yourmust know
whom I mean, and you must
know from whence he pilfered
his notions, concerning the first
beginning of the Hof Cs.

out the time when any tax was
laid upon any person by Pt,
that person being unrepresented
in Pt.The Plaid a tax
upon the palatinate of Chester,
and ordered commissioners to
collect it there, as
commissioners were ordered to
collect it in other counties; but
the palatinate refused to
comply; they addressee the
king by petition, setting forth,
that the English Phad no
right to tax them, that they had
a parliament of their own, that
they had always taxed
themselves, commissioners not
to proceed,,The king
received the petition; he did not
declare them either seditious or
rebellious, but allowed their
plea; and they taxed
themselves. Yourmay see
both the petition and the king's
answer in the records in the
Tower. The clergy taxed
themselves: When the P
attempted to tax them, they
stoutly refused; said they were
not represented there; that they
had a parliament of their own,
which represented the clergy;
that they would tax themselves:
They did so. Much stress has
been laid upon Wales, before it
was united as it now is, as if the
king, standing in the place of
their former princes of that
country, raised money by his
own authority: but the real fact
is otherwise; for I find that,
long before Wales was
subdued, the northern counties
of that principality had
representatives, and a
parliament or assembly. As to
Ireland, , before that
kingdom had a Pas it now
has, if yourwill examine the
old records, you will send, that
when a tax was to be laid on
that country, the Irish sent over
here representatives; and the

representatives received from
their constituents. In short, my
, from the whole of our
history, from the earliest

taxation and representation

proof to evince a truth, which
is, as it were, graved on the
heart is the every freeman. The
end of government is the good
of the majority; and when it is
diverted to the emolument of
one or a few, it then becomes
bad, it then becomes, detested
be the name, it then becomes, a
tyranny. When this is vested in
one, as in an unlimited
monarchy, it is bad, but much
more is it to be dreaded when
in the hands of many. Thus the
Decemviri at Rome, the Thirty
at Athens, the Doge and Senate
at Venice, were more woeful
tyrannies than even that of the
Grand Signior; and the most
tremendons tyranny that ever
exited would be the Houses of
Commons in England, if it
were independant of the
people; that is, if the seats were
fozlife. filled up when vacant
by the members themselves,
and they not affected by the
laws they made. If they made a
law to take away the property
of the people, their own would
be untouched; if to endanger
the lives of the people, they
themselves would not feel its
severity. From the dreadful
calamities of such a form of
government, if persisted in,
there could be no hope of relief
but from that which Mr. Lords
call and appeal to heaven. The
people, says he, have by a law,

that ultimate determined
determination to themselves,
which belongs to all mankind,

should say to the people of
England, we are virtual
representatives, and therefore
have a right to tax you; suppose
they were, upon this
declaration, to tax them
accordingly; what would the
people say? They would tell
their Lordships that they
possessed, and, have ever
possessed, a right by the
constitution, an unalienable
right, to chuse representatives,

BY a message from the
Governor of this province, to
the House of Representatives,
accompanied with an extract
from the East of Hillsborough's
letter, it appears that the
resolution of the former House,
which gave birth to their
circular letter to the other
colonies, has been represented
to his Majesty, in the odious
light of a party and measure;
and the raft House have been
required to rescind and disavow
it. They have maturely
considered the requisition, and
voted against a compliance
with it, by a majority of 92 to
17. Could any thing of this
nature appear strange on this
side the water, one would
wonder that a measure so
innocent is itself, so prudent, so
salutary for his Majesty's
American subjects, so
respectful to the Mothers
country, and so dutiful and
loyal to King, transacted in the
view of the world, and finally
laid before the Governor
himself, without the least
notice from him to the House
or the public, that he had any
unfavourable sentiments of it,
could be thus misrepresented:
But it has been the unhappy
fate of this province, perhaps of
all America, to be defamed and
abused without intermission, by
those who ought to afford to his
Majesty the best and truest
intelligence, and to fill under
His displeasure, at times when
they have flattered themselves
they were in the path of their
duty, and hoped for the Royal
protection and favour. Such are
the times, and such the country
we live in! There are enemies
to the King and to his people,
whome both have a sacred right
to expect things, who have
been incessantly endeavouring
to strike out sparks of jealousy
and discord, which may one
day prove fatal as an empire!
Behold what a great matter fire
kindleth! And unfortunately for
us, malignant whisperers seem
to have the attention of the
nation, while she is not that
there are men in America, some
perhaps whose rank and station
give her a just right of
confidence, who seek their own
greatness, tho' at the expence of
her utter ruin. These men are
not satisfied with defaming the
most worthy characters: They
must proscribes a province! a
continent! And in imitation of
that, hestis patria et humani
generis, they seem ardently to
thirst for a power to cut off the
whole people at one stroke!
These are not the suggestions
of party and faction. They are
the sentiments of the public:
They were lately drawn into a
dutiful and humble petition to
the throne; wherein, among
other articles of impeachment
of a Governor of a province, it
is alledged, ""that he has
practised the sending over
depositions to the ministry,
against Gentlemen of character,
without giving the accused the
least notice of his purposes and
proceedings."" And, ""That they
have reason apprehend, that he
has endeavoured to persuade
his Majesty's ministers to
believe that an intention was
formed, and a planted, in this
and the rest of the colonies
treasonably to withdraw
themselves, from all connection
with, and dependance upon
Great-Britain; and from their
natural allegiance to his
Majesty's sacred person and
government."" This petition was
read, and sustained, and partly
accepted; and very probably
would have been carried by a
very large majesty, if the
Governor had not immediately
prorogued, and afterwards
dissolved the Assembly. There
are men, a real faction, who
seem to aim at hurring the
people into despair and
distraction; but when this same
people have good sense enough
to pursue cool, dispassionate,
but firm, and manly, rational
and constitutional measures
Measures which the facti itself
dare not but apparently avow
Measures which even Governor
Bernard has been heard to say,
he would have heartily joined
in if desired; these men have
the Persidy and audacity to
represent them to his Majesty's
ministers as the designs of a
desperate, expiring faction,
tending to create unwarrantable
combinations, and to excite an
unjustifiable opposition to the
constitutional authority of the
Parliament! Good God! Shall
we be forever thus abused
without redress! Shall we be
incessantly dedefamed as rebels
and traitors! Do we deserve to
have ships of war before us, as
they now actually are in
appearance? Or can they be
designed to put weak women
and children into terror? Shall
we be perpetually threatened
with troops and dragooning, for
humbly laying before our royal
Sovereign, the distress brought
upon by the machinations of
his and our ; imploring his
gracious protection, and curling
upon our fellow subjects and
fellow sufferers, to join with us
in humble supplication! Is this
rebellion against a British
King! Will the nation much
longer be deceived! What must
be the event I May Heaven
avert the ruin of the British
empire! America, if properly
cherished now, will live to
support that, empire! America
may one day however, did
defiance to the proudest of her
enemies, and rise and shine
imperial in the western world:
This good land, not long since

and men more savage, may yet
be the happy retreat of
independance and freedom;
abundantly sufficient to make
some chosen her of the
Brunswick line, the most
glorious Poteate the world has
yet seen! Possibly you now
think me enthusiastic: I am
calm and fedate: Let Britain
live really Great, till in the
course of time she must share
the common fate of empires!
Till that event, it will be her
own and her colonies interest to
be united: These I Know must
be your sentiments as well as
mine: It is then our duty, as far
as lies in our power, to cultivate
and establish the important
union.

IT affords we the most grateful
satisfaction to find, by the
generous sentiments of your
address, that the measures I
pursued to suppress the late
insurrections in the country, are
honoured with your
approbation. The anxiety and

that service, it fully repaid by
the successful conduct of the
troops, and the thanks they
have merited and received from
your House, an honour I am
proud to share with them. The
estimates of their expences I
hope to be able to lay before
you to day; when I trust you
will find ways and means to
furnish the money to raise the
some as soon as possible. Tho'
your petition to his Majesty for
the emission of a paper
currency has not met with the
desired success, I sincerely
hope no impending ruin waits
this province from It's failure.
From the informations I
received in several part of this
province them I have travelled,
I am inclined to believe many
of the inhabitants are sufferers,
from the heavy burden of their
private obligations, which, by
the ingenuity of their creditors,
can only be discharged with
cash; This puts it out of the
power of the former to extricate
themselves from the load under
the present great scarcity of
money: If any expedient can be
found for this difficulty, it's
possible it was give great relief
to those under such unhappy
circumstances. I thank you,

great attention you assure me
you will pay to every matter I
have submitted to your
consideration, as for your kind

they spent several days in

sufficiently instructed, they
resolved to demand an

granted them. As soon as they
were introduced they declared
they were not deserters, but
engineers in the French service,
one a Frenchman, and the other
a Genoese; that that they were
charged to offer him 1000

up the place to his Most-

their promises, and consented
not to oppose the attempts of
the French, but to favour them
in every shape. The two
deserters withdrew, extremely

most happy issue; but how

in the midst of their jostity, they
were arrested, together with the

By Captain Brasher from Port au Prince we have confirmed accounts of great disturbances on the island of Hispaniola, on which occasion many of the planters there have been taken up and hanged without judge or jury. The real ground of the quarrel seems not to be well known, but it is said to be occasioned by the General Prince de Rohan's orders for every inhabitant to be trained up to the use of arms, and to be mustered once a month; which the planters refuting to obey, military executions ensued, from whence spring insurrections that have ended in the death of many of the inhabitants. It is generally thought to have some other foundation than this; for it is a known proverb, that when a dog is to be beat, it is easy finding a stick. Beetled effects of an arbitrary government.

from Doctor Robertson's
History of Charles V. of a
Conspiracy to overturn
the Government of
Genoa, as well as the
great Revolution which
that Event, extremely
mysterious in its first
Appearances, seemed to
portend, will, we hope, be
Matter of agreeable
Entertainment to many of
our Readers.
THE Form Government which
had been established in Games,
at the Time when Andrew
Doria restored Liberty to his
Country, though calculated to
obliterate the Memory of
former Distortions, and
received at first with eager
Approbation, did not, after a
Trail of near twenty Years, give
universal Satisfaction to these
turbulent and factious
Republicans. As the entire
Administrator of Affairs was
now lodged in a certain
Number of noble Families,
many, envying them that
Preeminence, wished for the
Restitution of a popular
Government, to which they had
been accu; and, though all rever
the disinterested Virtue of
Doria, and admired his Talents,
not a few were jealous of that
Ascendant which he had
acquired in all the Councils of
the Commonwealth. Mis Age,
however, his Moderation, and
Love of Liberty, afforded
ample Security to his
Countrymen that he would not
abuse his Power, nor stain the
Close of his Days by
attempting to overturn that
Fabrick, which had been the
Labour and Pride of his Life to
erect. But that Authority and
Insurance, which in his Hands
were innocent, they easily saw
would prove destructive, if
usurped by any Citizen of
greater Ambition, or less
Virtue. A Citizen of this
dangerous Character had
actually formed such
Pretensions, and with same
Prospect of Success. Gitino
Doria, whom his grand Uncle
Andrew destined to be the Heir
of his private Fortune, aimed
likewise at being his Successor
in Power. His Temper, haughty,
insolent, and overbearing, to
such a Degree as would scarce
have been tolerated in one born
to reign, was altogether
insupportable in the Citizen of
a five States; and the more
sagacious among the Genoese
already seared and hared him,
as the Enemy of those Liberties
for which they were indebted to
his Uncle. White Andrew
himself, by that violent and
undiscerning Affection which
Persons in advanced Age often
contract for the younger
Members of their Family, set
no Bounds to the Indulgence
with which he teamed him;
seeming less solicitants to
secure and perpetuate the
Freedom of the Commonwealth
than to aggrandise that
undeserving Kinsmen.
But what of Doria's Designs, or
whatever Dissatisfaction with
the Sys of Administrator in the
Commonwealth these
Circumstance might have
occasioned, they would have
ended, it is probable, in
Nothing more than
Murmurings and Complaints, if
John Lewis Fiasco, Cont of
Lavagna, observing this
growing Disgust, had not been
encouraged by it to attempt one
of the boldest Action corded in
History. That young Nobleman,
the richest and most isrious
Subject in the Republick, , in
an eminent Degree, all the
Qualities which upon the
human Heart, which command
Respect, or secure Attachment.
He was graceful and majestick
in his Person, magnificent to
Profusion of a Generosity that
prevented the Wishes of his
Friends, and exceeded the
Expectations of Strangers, of
an Address, gentle Manners,
and a flowing Affability. But
under the Appearance of these
Virtue, which seemed to form
him for enjoying and adorning
civil Life, he concealed all the
Dispositions which mark Men
one for taking the Lead in the
most dangerous and dark
Conspiracies; an insatiable and
restless Ambition, a Courage
unacquainted with Fear, and a
Mind that disdained
Subordination. Such a Temper
cold ill brook that Station of
Interiority wherein he was
placed in the Republick; and, as
he envied the Power which the
elder Doria had acquired, he
was with Indignation at the
Thoughts of its descending,
like an hereditary Possession,
to Gianntino. These various
Passions, preying with
Violence on his turbulent and
aspiring Mind, determined him
to overturning that Domination
to which he could not submit.
At first he though of an
Alliance with the King of
France, and even proposed it to
the French Ambassadour at
Rome; and, after expelling
Doria, together with the
Imperial Faction, by his
Assistance, he resolved to put
the Republick under the
Production of that Monarch,
hoping, in Return for that
Service, to be intrusted with the
principal Share in the
Administration of Government.
But, having communicated his
Scheme to a few chosen
Confidants, from whom he kept
Nothing secret, Verrina, the
Chief of them, a Man of
desperate Fortune, capable
alike of advising and executing
the most audacious Deeds,
remonstrated with Earnestness
against the Folly of exposing
himself to the most imminent
Danger, while he allowed
another to reap all the Fruits of
his Success; and exhorted him
warmly to aim himself at that
Preeminence in his Country to
which he was destined by his
illustrious Birth, was called by
the Voice of his Fellow
Citizens, and would be raised
by the Zeal of his Friends. This
Discourse opened such vast
Prospects to Fiesco, and so
suitable to his Genius, that,
abandoning his own Plan, he
eagerly adopted that of Verrina.
The other Persons present,
though sensible of the
hazardous Nature of the
Undertaking, did not choose to
condemn what their Patron had
so warmly approved. It was
instantly resolved, in this dark
Cabal, to assassinate the two
Dorias, as well as the principal
Persons of their Party, to
overturn the established System
of Government, and to place
Fiesco on the ducal Throne of
Genoa. Time, however, and
Preparations, were requisite to
ripen such a Design for
Execution; and, while
employed in carrying on these,
Fiesco made it his chief Care to
guard against every Thing that
might betray his Secret, or
create Suspicions. The Disguise
he assumed was of all others
the most impenetrable. He
seemed to be abandoned
entirely to Pleasure and
Dissipation. A perpetual Gaiety,
diversified by the Pursuit of all
the Amusements becoming his
Age and Rank, engrossed, in
Appearance, the Whole of his
Time and Thoughts. But,
amidst this Hurry of
Dissipation, he prosecuted his
Plan with the most cool
Attention, neither retarding the
Design by a timid Hesitation,
nor precipitating the Execution
by an Excess of Impatience. He
continued his Correspondence
with the French Ambassadour
at Rome, though without
communicating to him his real
Intentions, that by this Means
he might secure the Protection
of the French Arms, if hereafter
he should find it necessary to
call them to his Aid. He entered
into a close Confederacy with
Farness, Duke of Patina, who,
being disgusted with the
Emperour for refusing to grant
him the investiture of that
Dutchy, was eager to promote
any Measure that tended to
diminish his Influence in Italy,
or to ruin a Family so implicitly
devoted to him as that of Doria.
Being sensible that, in a
maritime State, the Acquisition
of naval Power was what he
ought chiefly to aim at, he
purchased four Gas from the
Pope, who probably was not
unacquainted with the Design
which he had formed, and did
not disapprove of it. Under
Colour of sitting out one of
there Gallies to sail on a Cruise
against the Turks, he not only
assembled a good Number of
his own Vassals, but engaged in
his Service many hold
Adventure, whom the Trace
between the Emperour and
Syman had ved of their usual
Occupation and Subsistence.
While Fiesco was taking these
important Steps, he preserved
so admirably his usual
Appearance of being devoted
entirely to Pleasure and
Amusement, and paid Court
with such artful Address to the
two Dorias, as imposed not
only on the generous and
unsuspicious Mind of Andrew,
but received Ganntino, who, of
his own criminal Intention, was
more apt to the Designs of
others. So many Instruments
being now preped. Nothing
remanded but to strike the
Blow. Various Consultations
were held by Fiesco with his ,
in Order to settle the Manner of
doing it with the greatest and .

The line was great as the D of

From then which stood by in
the Middle of a large Court
Wall. The Gates had been set in
the Me and all Persons, without
Distinction were allowed to ;
but strong Guards with in the
Court, suffered no One to
return. Verrina, mean White,
and a few Persons trusted with
the Secret of the Conspiracy,
after conducting Fiesco. Va as
well as the Crews of his Gather,
into the Palace, in small
Bodies, with as little Noise as
possible, dispersed themselves
through the City, and in the
Name of their Patron, invited to
an Entertainment the principal
Citizens whom they knew to be
disgusted with the
Administration of the Dorias,
and to have both Inclination
and Courage to attempt a
Change in the Government. Of
the vast Number of Persons
who now filled the Palace a
few only knew for what
Purpose they were assembled;
the rest, astonished at , instead
of the Preparations for a Feast,
a Court crowded with armed
Men, and Apartments tilled
with the Instruments of War,
gazed on each other with a
Mixture of Impatience,
Curiosity, and Terrour.
While their Minds were in this
State of Suspense and
Agitation, Fiesco appeared.
With a Look of Alacrity and
Confidence, he addressed
himself to the Persons of chief
Distinction, telling them that
they were not now called to
partake of the Pleasure of an
Entertainment, but to join in a
Deed of Valour which would
lead them to Liberty and
immortal Renown. He set
before their Eyes the exorbitant
as well as intolerable Authority
of the elder Doria, which the
Ambition of Cinetino and the
Partiality of the Emperour to a
Family more devoted to him
than to their Country, was
about to enlarge and to sender
perpetual. This unrighteous
Domination, continued he, you
have now in your Power to
subscriber, and to establish the
Freedom of your Country on a
firm Basis. The Tyrants must be
cut off. I have taken the most
effectual Measures for this
Purpose. My Associates are
numerous. I can depend on
Allies and Protectors, is
necessary. Happily, the Tyrants
are as secure as I have been
provident. Their insolent
Contempt of their Countrymen
has banished the Suspicion and
Timidity which usually render
the guilty quick signed to
discern, as well as sagacious to
guard against the Vengeance
which they deserve. They will
now feel the Blow before they
suspect any hostile Hand to be
nigh. Let us then sally forth,
that we may deliver our
Country by one generous
Effort, almost unaccompanied
with Danger, and certain of
Success. These Words, uttered
with that irresistible Favour
which animates the Mind when
roused by great Objects, made
the desired Impression on the
Audience. Fiesco's Vassals,
ready to execute whatever their
Master should commanded,
received his Discourse with a
Murmur of Applause. To many,
whose Fortunes were desperate,
the License and Confusion of
an Insurrection afforded an
agreeable Prospect. Those of
higher Rank, and more ous
Sentiments, durst not discover
the Surprise or Honour with
which they were struck at the
Proposal of an Enterprise so
unexpected and atrocious; as
each imagined the other to be
in the Secret of the Conspiracy,
and saw himself surrounded by
Persons who waited only a
Signal from their Leader to
perpetrate the greatest Crime.
With one Voice them all
applauded, or feigned to
applaud, the Undertaking.
Having thus fixed and
encouraged his Associates,
before he gave them his last
Orders he hastened for a
Moment to the Apartment of
his Wife, a Lady of the noble
House of Cibo, whom he loved
with tender Affection and
whose Beauty and Virtue
rendered her worthy of his
Love. The Noise of the armed
Men who crowded the Court
and Palace having long before
this reached her Ears, she
concluded some hazardous
Enterprise to be in Hand, and
she trembled for her Husband.
He found her in all the Anguish
of Uncertainty and Fear; and,
as it was now impossible to
keep his Design concealed, he
informed her of what he had
undertaken. The Prospect of a
Scene so full of Horrour, as
well as Danger, completed her
Agony; and, foreboding
immediately in her Mind the
final Issue of it, she
endeavoured, by her Tears, her
and her Despair, to divert him
from his Purpose. Fiesco, after
in to soothe and to inspire her
with Hope, broke from a
Situation into which an Excess
of Tenderness had unwarily
seduced him, though it could
not shake his Resolution.
""Farewell, he cried, as he
quitted the Apartment, you
shall other never see me more,
or you shall behold to-morrow
every Thing in Genoa subject
to your Power.""
As soon as he rejoined his
Companions he allotted each
his proper Station; some were
appointed to assault and the
different Gates of the City,
some to make themselves
Masters of the principal or
Places of Strength. Fiesco
received for himself the Attack
of the Harbour where Doria's
Gallies were laid up, as the
Post of chief Importance, and
of greatest Danger. It was now
Midnight, and the Citizens
slept in the Security of Peace,
when this Band of
Conspirators, numerous,
desperate, and well armed,
rushed out to execute their
Plan. They surprised, without
Resistance, some of the Gates.
They got Possession of others,
after a sharp Conflict with the
Soldiers on Guard. Verrina,
with the Galley which had been
fitted out against the Turks,
blocked up the Month of the
Dorsna, or little Harbour where
Doria's Fleet lay. All Possibility
of Escape being by this
Precaution cut off, when Fiesco
attempted to enter the Gallies
from the Shore to which they
were made fast, as they were
unrigged and disarmed, having
no Crew on Board but the
Slaves chained to the Oar, they
were in no Condition to make
Resistance. Every Quarter of
the City was now filled with
Noise and Tumult, all the
Streets resounding with the Cry
of ""Fiesco and Liberty."" At that
Name, so popular and beloved,
many of the lower Rank took
Arms, and joined the
Conspirators. The Nobles and
Partisans of the Aristocracy,
astonished or affrighted, shut
the Gates of their Houses, and
thought of Nothing but
securing them from Pillage. At
last, the Noise, excited by this
Scene of Violence and
Confusion, reached the Palace
of Doria. Giann started
immediately from his Bed; and,
imagining that it was
occasioned by some Mutiny
among the Sailors, rushed out
with a few Attendants, and
hurried towards the Harbour.
The Gate of St. Thomas,
through which he had to pass,
was already in the Possession
of the Conspirators, who, the
Moment he entered, sell upon
him with the utmost Fury, and
murdered him on the Spot. The
same must have been the Fate
of the elder Doria, if Jerome de
Fiesco had executed his
Brother's Plan, and had
proceeded immediately to
attack him in his Palace; but, he
from the sordid Consideration
of preventing its being
plundered amidst the
Confusion, having forbid his
Followers to advance, Andrew
got Intelligence of his
Nephew's Death, as well as of
his own Danger, and, mounting
on Horseback, saved himself
by Flight. Mean While a few
Senators had the Courage to
assemble in the Palace of the
Republick. At first some of the
most daring among them
attempted to rally the scattered
Solders, and to attack a Body
of the Conspirators; but, being
repulsed with Lose, all agreed
that Nothing now remained but
to treat with the Party, which
seemed to be irresistible.
Deputies were accordingly sent
to learn of Fiesco what were
the Concessions with which he
would be satisfied, or rather to
submit to whatever Terms he
should please to prescribe.
But by this Time Fiesco, with
whom they were empowered to
negotiate, was no more. Just as
he was going to leave the
Harbour, where every Thing
had succeeded to his Wise, that
he might join his victorious
Companions, he heard some
extraordinary Uproar on Board
the Admiral Galley. Alarmed at
the Noise, and seating that the
Slaves might break their C, and
overpower his Associates, he
ran thither; but, the Plank
which reached from the Shore
to the Vessels happening to
overturn, he fell into the Sea,
whilst he hurried forward too
precipitately. Being loaded with
heavy Armour, he sunk to the
Bottom, and per in the very
Moment when he must have
taken full Possession of every
Thing that his ambitious. Heart
could desire. Verrina was the
first who discovered this fatal
Accident, and, foresting, at
once, all its Consequences,
concealed it with the utmost
Industry from every One but a
few Leaders of the Comp Nor
was it difficult, amidst the
Darkness and Confusion of the
Night, to have kept it secret,
until a Treaty with the Senators
should have put the City in the
Power of the Co. All then
Hopes of th were disconcerted
by the Imprudence of Jerome
Fiesco, who, when the Deputies
of the Senate inquired for his
Brother, the Count of Lavagna,
that they might make their
Proposals to him, replied, with
a child Vaty. ""I am now the

marched immediately for the
settlements of these rebels, who
had returned with avowed
intentions of opposing his
march; and they being, in
appearance, as desirous of
meeting us, as we could
possibly be to meet them a few
days, brought us within three
miles of each other It was
expected, that they would have
opposed our passage over the
Haw river, where the ford was
so desensible, that it must have
cost a good deal of blood to
have effected a passage, but by
a brick march we happily
arrived there a day sooner than
they expected us, and reach
where we are now the 13th inst.
The people round about us
being generally malecontnets, it
was impossible to obtain any
intelligence, relative to the
insurgents, that we could
depend upon, except that their
number was considerable and
that they were determined to
give us battle. On the 15th they
sent to his excellency a paper,
which they called a petition
purpoting that they desired his
excellency redress their
grievances in a manner
satisfactory to THEM, as the
only means of preventing that
bloodsbed, which from the
arder of the leaders and the
troops on both sides, must
otherwise ensue, and desired an
answer in four hours. The
messenger was dispatched with
a reply that his excellency
would send them an answer by
twelve clock the next day,
notwithstanding which, Mr.
John Asbe (son of Mr. Samuel
Ashe)and Mr. john Walker,
who were sent out of camp
upon duty, were seized by these
people on the very same night
not far from our camp, tucked
up to trees, severely whipped,
and made prisoners of till we
released them the next entered
into the evening before we
marched about sun rise in
search of these rebles whom we
found encamped about 3 miles
form our station, when we
came within half a mile of them
three guns were fired as a
signal to form in the order of
battle which was immediately
done, in two lines about an
hundred yards form each other
They answered our guns by
three huzza's and by beating to
arms by which they shewed
how resolved they were to give
us battle His excellency having
sent them in answer to their
petition that as he bad in every
circumsrance both un his
particular and legislative
charcter pursued every mesure
in his particular and legistive

was left him now to offer but
that the must make an

that should follow must be
imputed to them when our

patience to read the proposal
but did him return to BILLY
TKYON, and tell him that they
desied him and that BATTLE
was what they wanted some of
their leaders however prevailed
in them to sisten but they again
expressed impatience to engage
with the most horried oaths that
they would put every one of us
to where we halted. They were
also advancing in order of
battle and their number
surprised us we did not believe
it possible that so many men
could implicitly be under the
insluences of such men as
Hermon Husbands James
hunter rednap howell &C. and
in so bad a cause.They came in
that order to a strait reach of the
road when they halted waving
their hats fo us to advance and
daring us to do it Hs
excellencey then sent a
magistarce with an officer to
read the proeclamation
agreeable to act of assembly
ordering them ot disperse
within a hour which he read
accordingly but they disdained
to listen BATTLE, BATTLE,
BATTLE, was their cry which
they said they impatiently
ecpected that they only waited
for us to fire the first gun which
they dared us to do This
conduct incensed our people to
such a degree that it wasa
dissicult to keep the from
ruthing upon the enemy The
unseigned arfor they expressed
gave the officers of the army
the pleasing and certain
assurance, of not being deserted
by their men; which in men
new raised and many fo them
connected with the rebels was a
circumstances not impossible
to suppose might happen. The
Governor with a coolness
peculiar to himself bore these
insults with patience still the
hour expired which time he
spent in visting the lines
company by company putting
every thing in
order,recommending to the
officers and men not to fall into
disorder and shewing by his
steadiness and serenity and by
the judicious disposition he
made of the troops that courage
and that military skill which
every general ought to possess
Being infomed that the
insurgents had an intention of
putting mr walker and mr Ashe
in the front of their line a
message was sent them by his
excellency, that a be should
keep the prisoner we had in a
place of safety, be depended
they would od the same by
messrs. walker and Ashe They
returned no direct answer to
this but said they would give
them up provided his
excellency would give up all
we had taken of theirs. This
unequial exchange was
extremely granting to the
governor as if implied a
concession on the side of
government not quite
consistent with the resolutions
we had taken but all of us
joining in a petition to his
excellency to couply with it lest
they should hang up walker and
ashe he was so good as to grant
our request and sent the word
provided they would send the
gentlemen to him be would
send our prisoners (in number
seven) immediately to them
The agreed to this but being
very tardy in the execution abd
our people complaining that
standing in the sun began ot
make them saint and clamoring
to advance upon the enemy it
was thought adviseable to lead
them on. we marched in
profound silence and in exact
order upon to breast our troops
were ordered not to fire till they
received his excellency orders,
so that they were almost mixed
with those of the enemy who
were statined at a little distance
before their main body they
them slowly retreated to join
their army bellowing forth
defiance, and daring us to fire.
We proceeded still within 101
or 25 yards of them when we
halted They continued revulling
us, daring us to fire and asking
us, why we delayed that
BATTLE BATTLE was their

excellency had promised not to
fire upon them till the prisoners
were delivered up, and till he
gave them notice and he would
not break his word even with
those insatuated wretches
During this time we saw them
gong to the places they had
agreed to occupy and these
were best calculated to secure
them selves and annoy us. They
had waited to receive us, so had
anopportunity it chuse their

consessed they chose it with
judgment the grond they
paraded upon was the place

brought word they would

We have the Pleasure to acquaint the Publick that Sir William Johnson is now recovered to a good State of Health.

Advice is received from Honduras Bay, dated the 29th of May last, that the Day before the Inhabitants at St. George's Key were alarmed with an Account of an Insurrection having happened among the Negroes in the Old River, which broke out amongst the Slaves belonging to Walter Davidson, who, when the Accounts came away, had murdered two white Men, and being powerful in Number, were proceeding to the next Mahogany Works, to invite or force the Slaves to Join them. A Number of Inhabitants, joined to a Detachment of Sailors from the Diligence Man of War, properly victualled and armed, are just now preparing to set of in Quest of the Revolvers. Every Person possessed of Families and Property in the different Rivers is obliged to quit the Keys, and proceed thither. Such Negroes as are suspected on this Key were last Night taken up, and confined on Board the Man of War. Every Precaution is taken to prevent any farther Disorder, and it is hoped the Insurrection will, with the Blessing of God, be subdued in a Short Time.

under their insults."" Sir, I am
sorry to say that this is
declamation, unbecoming the
character and place of him who
utters it. In what moment have
you been quiet? Has not your
government for many years
past been a series of irritating
and offish five measures,
without policy, principle, or
moderation? Have not your
troops and your ships made a
vain and insulting parade in
their streets and in their
harbours? It has seemed to be
your study to irritate and
instame them. You have
stimulated discontent into
dissatisfaction, and you are
goading that dissatistaction into
rebellion. Can you expect to be
well informed when you listen
only to portizans? Can you
expect to do justice when you
will not hear the accused?
Let us consider, Sir, the
precedents which are offered to
warrant this procceding.The
suspension of the Habeas
Corpus Act in 1745the
making smugglers triable in
Middlesex, and Scotch rehels
in England. Sir, the first was
done upon the most pressing
necessity, slagrante BeHo, with
a dangerous rebellion in the
very heart of the kingdom in
the second, you well know, it
was warranted by the most
evident facts; armed bodies of
smugglers marched publicly
without presentment or
molestation from the people of
the county of Sussex; who,
even to their magistrates were
notoriously connected with
them. They murdered the
officers of revenue, engaged
our troops, and openly violated
the laws. Experience convinced
you, that that the juries of that,
and of the counties similarly
circumstanced, would never
find such criminals guilty; and
upon the conviction of this
necessity you passed the act.
The same necessity justified
trying Scotch rebels in
England. Rebellion had reared
its dangerous standard in
Scorland, and the principles of
it had so universally tainted
that people, that it was
manisestly in vain to expect
justice from them against their
countrymen. But in America
not a single act of rebellion has
been committed. Let the Crown
law officers, who fit by the
noble Lord, declare, if they ca
that there is upon your table a
single evidence of treason or
rebellion in America. They
know, Sir, there is not one, and
yet we are proceeding as if
there were a thousand,
Having thus proved, Sir, that
the proposed Bill is without
precedent to support, and
without facts to warrant it; let
us now view the consequences
it is like to produce. A soldier
feels himself so much above
the rest of mankind, that the
strict hand of the civil power is
necessary to controul the
haughtiness of disposition
which superiority inspires. You
know, Sir, what constant care is
taken in this country to remind
the military that they are under
the restraint of civil power. In
America their superiority is felt
still greater. Remove the check
of the law, as the Bill intends,
and what insolence, what
outrage may you not expect
Every passion that is not
pernicious to society will be let
loose upon a people
unaccusromed to licentionsness
and intemporace, On the one
hand will be a people who have
been long complaining of
oppression, and see in the
soldiery those who are to
enforce at upon them; on the
other an army studiolsly
prepossessed with the idea of
that people being rebelliouos,
unawed by the apprehension of
civil controul; and actuated by
that arbitrary spirit which
prevails even among the best of
troops. In this situation the
prudent officer will find it
impossible to restrain his
soldiers, or prevent that
provocation which will rouse
the tamest people to resistance.
The inevitable consequence
will be, that you will produce
the rebellion you pretend to
obviate.
I have been bred'a foldies, have
served long. I respect the
prosession, and live in the
strictest libits of friendship with
a great many officers; but there
is not a country gentleman of
you all, who looks upon the
army wiltlia more jealous eye,
or would more strenuot fly
reflit the feeting them above the
controut of the civil power: No
land is to be trusted is such a
situation. It is not the fault of
the soldier, but the vice of
hurnan nature, which,
unbridled by law, becomes
insolent and U cebtuiysm
wabtibtt violates the peace of
society, and tramples upon the
rights of human Kind.
With respect to those
gentlemen who are destined to
this service, they are much to
be pitied. It is a service, which
an officer of feeling and of
worth must enter upon with
infinite reluctance. A service, in
which his only merit must be,
to bear much, and to little.
With the melancholy prospect
before him of commencing a
civil war, and embruing his
hands in the blood of his fellow
subjects; his feelings, his life,
his honour are hazarded,
without a possibility of any
equivalent or compensation.
You may perhaps think a law,
founded upon this motion, will
be his protection. I am
mistaken if is will. Who is to
execute it? He must be a bold
men indeed who makes the
attempt. If the people are so
exasperated, that it is unsafe to
bring the man who has injured
them to trial, let the Governor
who withdraws him from
justice look to himself. The
people will not endure it; they
would no longer deserve the
reputation of being deseended
from the loins of Englishmen,
if they did endure it.
When I stand up as an advocate
for America, I feel myself the
firmest friend of this country.
We stand upon the commerce
of America. Alienate your
colonies, and you will subvert
the foundation of your riched
and your strength. Let the
banners of rebellion be once
spread in America, and you are
an undont people. You are
unging this desparate, this
destructive issue. You are
urging it with such violence,
and by measures tending so
manifestly to that fatal point
that, but that a state of madnols
could inspiare such an
intention, it would appear to be
your deliberate purpose. In
assenting to your late Bill I
resisted the violence of
America, at the hazard of my

disciplined troops over the
provincials; but beware how

Instead of sending them the

Ask their aid in a constitutional

required. Your journals bear the
recorded acknowledgments of
the real with which they have

necessities of the state. What

""I am extremely concerned at the Measures pursuing by Great Britain against the Colonies, for poor Boston in particular. It could never be meant that the was to be the sole Butt of theirI will call no harsh Names. The rest of the Colonies were in full Perspective. Gradual in Execution, was the most probable Means of gaining and Establishing a Precedent. The Capital subdued to Obedience would have been sufficient, to every Purpose. By Obedience, I mean Obedience to the extraordinary new Mandates; and I can assure you that but few who know the interest of the English Carihbee Island but must, and do, approve the Measures adopted by the Town of Boston. It cannot be conceived by you, on the Continent, what a Confusion the Suspension of Supplies to the Island would occasion. Insurrections among the Negroes must be the Inevitable Consequence. Hunger is, and ever will be, a Means to drive Men upon every practicable Means to appease its Gnawings. The Islands formerly raised Negro Provisions, such as Tams, Potatoes, and India Corn, nearly sufficient for each Plantation, and had from North America the Remainder, but the Grounds so appropriated have of late Years been constantly improved in Canes, as more profitable; and the Food brought from the Colonies being not only cheaper, but more solid and agreeable in Taste, the withdrawing in from the Slaves, now accustomed to it, would be sufficient to breed a Mutiny throughout the Estates. The Property of many of these Estates, improved by their A gents, and stocked with from 2 to 7 or 800 Negroes, residing in many of the leading Men in London, Bristol, and other capital Seaports, interest would render them your Advocates, rather than suffer such immense Fortunes to run to Ruin.

""In short, a suspension of Supplies would oblige the Planters to discontinue the Culture of Canes, and it could by no Means be speedily recovered. The Islands cannot subsist for any Time without Provisions from the Continent, and sew indeed of the inhabitants are there but already Groan with Apprehension that the dreaded Suspension may take Place.

""I should conceive a second Consideration would draw the Attention of those Gentlemen to the common Welfare, viz. the French King's Death, and the Measeres that Nation are taking in their Islands. It is not six Months since several Troops arrived at Martinico and Guadaloupes which are distributed in. Reinforcements to their Garrisons. A Continuance or Renewal of this Police has very lately taken Place. About eight Days ago a Brig landed 100 fresh Troops at Port Royal, and then proceeded to St. Domingo. The French say 900 more are on their Passage for same Place, in different Vessels. Their Artisans are all employed on Fortresses, adding and repairing; and many new Batteries and Redoubts are erecting in a Private Manner, even where no probable Service, by Prevention to Land, can be expected them. In their gasconading Way, they are very soon to conquer much of America, as well as these Island. War seems planning in Martinico, I hope no Where else in this critical Conjuncture. God only knows what would be the Event. Their several Preparations are unaccountable. I wish all Matters were reconciled led, to be in Readiness for what may happen""

At a Town Meeting on Tuesday last, the Methods proposed for employing such as are out of Business by the Operation of the Port Bill were approved. A circular Letter to the other Towns, relative to the lil forcating, our charter, was reported, and accepted by the Town. The Meeting stands adjourned to Tuesday the 9th of August.

By captain Lovett, arrived last week in this Town after a short Passage to Portsmouth from Antigua, we learn that the Merchants and Planners were in great Consternation there on reading the proposals of the Colonies for suspending their supplies of Lumber and provisions, which they agree much be ruinous to them; and in consequence, they have appropriated a Third of their Cane plantation for the culture of Indian Corn, Yams, Potatoes, &c. for the Maintenance of their Slaves , in Cafe the Suspension does take place. It is father said Antigua has sent home a Remonstrance on that Head, praying Great Britain either to open the port of Boston, and let them have provisions as usual, or furnish them with the absolute Necessaries of Life themselves; otherwise, they, their Sugar-planting must speedily come to an End, as they can neither support their Slaves , nor ship the Sugars home, for Want of casks. Notwithstanding the Distress in which they foresee they must be involved by our Discontinuance of Trade with them, they generously commend us for the Resolutions, acknowledging that in our circumstances any Measure we can hold on for Relief from the chains imposing upon us is fully justifiable.

A Cart Lord of new Pickaxe was seen putting into a store on the Long Wharf, last Saturday. Query , what are we to apprehend from all these warlike preparations? is a Fort to be erected in good earnest, and the Town to be awed into submission by cannons and Mortars!

connected with the
perseverance of our American
brethren in their opposition to

Should they continue firm it
will be scarcely possible that
they should not succeed in
preserving their liberties; and
the preservation of their liberty
ought to be an object of the last
concern to al in this country, for
it is only among them we can
expect to find it, after luxury,
dissipation, a servile

overwhelming load of debts

ruin here. I cannot help
believing that this will be the

will have with us if they are
now steady and succeed. they
will have no reason to fear any
future attempts to enslave
them; but if they now submit
they will be subdued forever,
and the only nursery of freemen
now inn the world will be loss.
I cannot indeed imagine a state
of worse slavery than that in
which the colonies would be
were they on this occasion to
submit to be not only subject to
many hard restraints in aspired
their property but to hold it
after being acquired, at the
discretion of our rulers; to have
no constitutions of government

laws made and their
government modeled by a

the Ailanthic, which cannot
judge of their circumstances, in
which they have no voice, and
all whose acts are but little
more than echoes to the will of
the tyrant who happens to be
minister in this country. What
an abject condition would this
be! The present slate of our
parliament is such that it is our
own greatest calamity to be
governed by it. How safe
would it be to with the
Americans in in the same
calamity? The mode of
opposition which the
Americans are likely to adopt
mutt do them the greatest
service, by checking luxury
among them, and obliging them
to save the money they now
spend among us in purchasing
superfluities. At the same time

such are our present
circumstances, that we hang
upon the American trade: and
the loss of it would sink the
revenue, and soon bring on
riots and insurrections, and a
public bankruptcy. But I am not
frightened by these
Consequences. The
preservation of America liberty
I think of unspeakably more
importance than my temporary
sufferings which can come
upon us. I also consider our
present state as so corrupt, and
our excellent constitution of

subverted by the unbounded
influence of the crown, that my
only hope arises from the
prospect of a convulsion
(dreadful while it lasts) which
shall destroy artificial wealth
and all the means of corruption,
reduce us to poverty and
simplicity, overturn the whole
system of policy, and be
followed by the re-

spirited ADDRESS to his
MAJESTY is prefixed ,
just published, entitled A
SUMMARY VIEW OF
THE RIGHTS OF
BRITISH AMERICA.
TO THE KING.
SIRE,
THERE is not a man of thought
in the whole nation was does
not esp bad measures from bad
principles, but is justly
alarmed, and seriously anxious
for the common good. Affairs
of such magnitude now employ
the public attention as seem to
involve in them the fate of .
The times are big with great
events. What will be the
consequence it is not in human
sagacity to foretell. But it the
same system be pursued, which
for a long time hath employed
the attention of your majesty's
ministers, they ought to tremble
for their heads.
The present contentions with
America, if not soon happily
terminated, must end in such
scenes of trouble, bloodshed,
and devastation, which, in
contemplation alone, shock us
with horror. But little time
remains for deliberation or
choice; a blow will lead on to
the decisive scene, and the
sword must end what tyranny
began. This of your majesty's
reign is likely to be marked
with the most important
characters. It is impossible for
subjects to stand by idle,
unaffected spectators, when
they see their sovereign and
themselves nearly involved in
distresses, which, for aught he
can foresee, may end in the ruin
of both. You sir, may lose your
sovereignty and honour, we our
liberties, fortunes, and lives.
The charge of presumption
upon individuals, for speaking
freely upon these important
things, is at once taken off, by
the evidence of the things
themselves, and the
transcendent interest that every
man has in them. Of the modes
of carrying on the weighty
affairs of state, of the artifice,
cunning, address, and subtilty
of courts, It is the general lot to
be ignorant; but of the great
principles of government,
especially of this free state, of
those laws and proceedings that
are either subversive or
corroborative of the system,
many are as liable to judge as
any minister employed in his
majesty's service. There, with
first laws of nature, the
prerogatives of man in human
society, with the sacred and
immutable laws of justice,
equity, moderation, and
wisdom, men fully understand,
who were never tutored or well
received at court, where,
indeed, for the most part, men
are more likely to lose than
gain accurate ideas of these
things. They are not among the
anan imp; we can judge of
them, and have a fair,
undoubted, constitute right, as
free subjects, who claim liberty
by birthright, and enjoy it by
the law, to apply these
principles to the present
conduct of your Majesty's
ministers; and, in justice bound
to our country and ourselves,
and that fidelity we owe, sir, to
you, as our sovereign, we
openly declare that the whole
proceedings against our
brethren in America, who are
entitled in common with
ourselves to the privileges of
men, and the liberties,
franchises, and protection of
Englishmen, are in open
violation of the unnatural laws
of equity and justice, and
unparallelled infractions upon
the principles and promulgated
laws of this free state, not to
say that every idea of good
policy is sacrificed to maintain
and enforce the most vicious
and dangerous system that ever
infatuated despots pursued.",nonslave

Anxious to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country, and to induce a firmer reliance on the goodness and tenderness of our most gracious Sovereign to all his subjects equally, and on the wisdom of his councils for a redress of all their real grievances, which can only be obtained by loyal and constitutional applications, I again call upon the require all his Majesty's liege subjects, and especially all magistrates and other officers, both civil and military, to exert themselves in removing the discontents, and suppressing the spirit of faction, which prevail among the people, that a dutiful submission to the laws of the land may be strictly observed, which shall ever be the rule of my conduct, as the interest and happiness of this dominion ever have been, and shall continue to be, the objects of my administration.

GIVEN under my hand, and the seal of the colony, at Williamsburg,

The Virginia Gazette,3,Alexander Purdie,1775_06_16,"June 16, 1775",1775,"FROM the disposition which the enemies of this country have already shewn, there is but too much reason to suspect that the late proceedings in this colony will be represented in England in a light the most unfavourable to the people; and perhaps some actions may have been committed, which, to those who view them from a distance, and have not felt the provocations which led to them, may appear violent and unjustifiable. To enable mankind, therefore, to form a proper judgment of what has passed, a plain narrative of facts seems necessary, a narrative published upon the spot, where any falsehood may be contradicted, any errour or partiality corrected, and every measure supported by its true motives. Something of this kind has appeared to every one necessary, it has been looked for, but the general expectation has been disappointed; and it is to be feared, that our friends in other countries will interpret out silence into an inability to justify our conduct, whilst our enemies will triumph, in the supposition that we have at length quitted the paths of wisdom and of virtue. Such considerations as these have induced me to attempt what I wished to see from some abler hand; and probably my weak endeavours may be the means of rousing others, who are more capable, of doing justice to the subject.

The rise and progress of the present troubles in America are so well known, through most pasts of the world, and our resistance to arbitrary power so generally applauded, that I may well be excused from looking far backwards, and from vindicating the first steps of American opposition. Though Virginia most heartily concurred, and in many instance took the lead, in the virtuous struggles of the colonies, yet, till lately, she was free from those direful effects of ministerial tyranny which some other parts of the continent experienced. The first thing which particularly disturbed her tranquillity was a threatened insurrection of her negro slaves , in the beginning of the spring 1775. Whether this was general, or who were the instigators, remains as yet a secret. There was reason, however, to believe that most of the negroes were too well affected to their masters, and too apprehensive of the bad consequences, as well as suspicious of the friendship of our adversaries, to join in such a wicked scheme. From some hints, it was inferred that the negroes had not been without encouragement from a Gentleman of the Navy, who has distinguished himself lately in our rivers. Whatever the plot was, it was seasonably discovered, and effectual measures taken to suppress it. To the Northward, the storm seemed to thicken; every ship from England brought intelligence of some fresh instance of ministerial vengeance denounced against us; our hopes of peace and redress from that quarter declined daily; and we saw nothing before us but abject slavery , or the horrours of a civil war. We viewed the alternative with sorrow, but hesitated not a moment which to prefer. The Convention of March 1775 directed that the colony should be put into the best posture of defence, and that, whilst every step was taken to procure an honourable reconciliation, nothing should be omitted which could enable us, by the sword, to defend our just rights and privileges. In the third week of April, the country was again alarmed, by the Governour's removing in the night from the colony magazine, and putting on board his Majesty's schooner the Magdalen, Capt. Collins, fifteen barrels of gunpowder, nearly the whole which the magazine at that time contained; and it was also discovered, that he had spoiled several of the fire-arms of their locks. Upon the first intelligence of this action, many of the inhabitants of Williamsburg flew to their arms, and resolved in that way to demand reparation. No violence, however, was committed; they were persuaded to disperse, and the common hall addressed his Excellency. Their address set forth, that the magazine was erected at the publick expense of the colony, and appropriated to the safe-keeping of such munition as should be lodged there, for the protection and security of the country, to be used by the militia in case of invasions or insurrections , and that it was, therefore, the only proper repository to be resorted to in times of imminent danger; that, from various reports of internal insurrections , that utmost attention to their security was become necessary; and they therefore desired to know his motive for carrying off the powder in such a manner, and entreated him immediately to return it to the magazine. To this his Excellency replied, that the report of an insurrection in a neighbouring county had induced him to remove the powder from the magazine, where he did not think it safe, to a place of perfect security; that he would return it, when it was wanted on any insurrection ; that he had removed it in the night, to prevent any alarm; that he was surprised to hear the people were under arms on this occasion, and that should not think it prudent to put powder into their hands in such a situation. This answer gave no satisfaction: The people could not conceive how disarming them would discourage their negroes from rising, should they be so disposed; nor could they divine how he could procure the powder, upon any emergency, from a vessel whose station for one hour war uncertain. The magazine had never yet been attempted by the negroes; and, had this been apprehended, they thought it might easily have been secured by a guard. Upon the whole, they looked upon the Governour's answer as evasive and insulting; and the people were, with difficulty, kept within the bounds of moderation.",blackUnrest

My Lord ,

WE his Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Burgesses of Virginia, beg leave to inform your Lordship, that the publick magazine is now repaired, and in fit condition for the reception of arms and ammunition.

We therefore request your Lordship will be pleased to order the powder, lately removed from thence, to be returned, agreeable to your Lordship's promise, continued in your written message to this House. We farther beg leave to inform you Lordship, that it appears to the House, form the report of their committee appointed to inspect the publick magazine, that there are no arms therein sit for service. At this critical time, my Lord, when your Excellency assures us of the great probability of an Indian invasion, at a time too when an insurrection of our slaves may be encouraged, merely from a notoriety of a total deficiency in our publick stores of arms and ammunition, it is a duty we owe to our country and ourselves to remind your Lordship, that the legislature of this colony have long since made ample provision for the purchase of arms and ammunition, and established a competent fund for that purpose, by granting to his Majesty one shilling and three pence sterling upon the tunnage of all vessels trading to this country. This fund, my Lord, had, for several years last past, exceeded three thousand pounds sterling per annum; and our predecessors, in former Assemblies, trusting that government would always make a necessary and adequate provision in a matter so essential to the immediate and future preservation of this colony, have not interfered in this business. But, my Lord, this House, finding a total inattention in government to his important provision, although it must have appeared essential more than twelve months ago, and still observing that no means are pursued to supply a deficiency so alarming, now conceive it to be their duty, not only to represent this grievance to your Lordship, but also to request that you will be pleased to order that two thousand stand of arms, five tuns of powder, and twenty tuns of lead, at least, with a sufficient quantity of other military stores, be immediately provided for the defence of this colony, in case of any invasion or insurrection , and that the same be lodged in the publick magazine. In case the fund afore-mentioned shall prove deficient, this House assure your Lordship, that they will make such farther or other provision as may be necessary to enable your Lordship to comply with this request.",blackUnrest

The Virginia Gazette,3,Alexander Purdie,1775_08_04,"August 4, 1775",1775,"Mr . PURDIE,

THERE are few attempts in life so unlikely to give universal satisfaction as those that are brought before the all scrutinising eye of the publick; for although a man be so fortunate as to please some, he may, on the other hand, offend many: And there are some men, possessed of a tolerable knowledge of men and manners, but what must be, on the least attentive consideration, assured of the truth of this thesis. How careful then ought that man to be, who makes his appearance in the publick papers, in knowing that he is embarked, if not in an unoffending, yet a righteous cause! Thus equipped, he may fearless pass the rock of criticism, if not with eclat, with that, at least, which affords more permanent felicity, the heartfelt commendation of a good conscience. These animadversions lead me to a few strictures on our truly great and worthy governour's proclamation, published in mess. Dixon and Hunter's paper of the 13th of this instant. I confess, in the first place, that it is with the most pungent sorrow I find that justice, and the great cause of America's inherent rights, make it indispensably necessary, in those unhappy days, that nothing should pass unnoticed that is not dignified by the sacred signature of truth, and which, through the malversation of bad and designing men, might have the baneful tendency of extending the unnatural breach between Great Britain and her colonies, and bring on the additional displeasure of our gracious king . Of such a tendency appears our governour's proclamation of the above date, particularly aimed at PATRICK HENRY, Jun. esq; his country's, and America's, unalterable and unappalled great advocate and friend. As most of the good people of this country may have seen this unparalleled proclamation, I shall not take up much of their or your time, mr. Purdie, in a very recital of it; suffice to say, that the whole must appear a mere ministerial trick, calculated to please some, to delude others, and, what is of more serious and alarming consequence (similar to one of his other laudable efforts *) to prejudice and detract from the great American cause, by effecting a disunion amongst the friends of it, as the only possible means of obtaining success to ministerial machinations. The degenerate tools of lawless power may applaud his lordship's ingenuity, but the honest, virtuous, and upright sons of constitutional liberty, will reprobate the want of that candour and nobleness of spirit which alone can give effulgence to high birth or exalted station, and deprived of which, either the one, or the other, must, in the reflection of the virtuous mind (to use the great mr. Pope's word) appear but as so much ""Leather or prunella."" There are, however, representations of the conduct of the said mr. HENRY, and his deluded followers (as his lordship is pleased, fashionably, to call them) so exceedingly inconsonant to my idea of the case, that his lordship must pardon me if I should, for the sake of justice, attempt to set the matter in a different and less partial point of view. He lordship observes, ""that the said mr. Henry, with a number of deluded followers, had taken up arms, chosen their officers, and, stiling themselves an independent company, had marched out of their county, encamped, and put themselves into a posture of war; and had written letters &c. to the great terrour of all his majesty's faithful subjects, and in open defiance of law and government; and have committed other acts of violence, particularly in extorting from his majesty's receiver general the sum of 3301. under pretence of replacing the powder he (the governour) thought proper to order from the magazine; whence, adds his lordship, it undeniably appears that there is no longer the least security for the life or property of any man."" Would not strangers to this manoeuvre of mr. HENRY 's be induced readily to believe, from this proclamation of his lordship, that his conduct in the affair of the powder was directly consistent with the greatest rectitude; and, on the contrary, that mr. HENRY 's behaviour was, in the extreme, impolitical, disorderly, and base? But let such first recur to the many poor subterfuges that ministerial vicegerents have lately been drove to, and then they will not be greatly astonished at the contents of his lordship's proclamation.

The powder which was removed from the magazine in the city of Williamsburg, under covert of the night (a time most friendly and best adapted to dark and insidious designs) appears clearly to have been, if not the permanent and exclusive property of this colony, at least so intended for its direct emolument and protection, by an act of Assembly passed in the first year of king George the 1st's reign, entitled An act for erecting a magazine ;"" that his lordship's removal of it on board one of his majesty's armed vessels, just at that alarming and critical time, was, in my view, illegal, and a competent declaration of his hostile and inimical designs against this unhappy country; and sufficient, of itself, to have roused the good people of it from that lethargick state of security into which the great appearance of his lordship's friendship had lulled them; and farther, to have placed themselves in such a posture of defence as might enable them to guard against the impending blow which this step of his lordship plainly told them was but too fast approaching. The inhabitants of Williamsburg, justly alarmed and incensed at such behaviour from his lordship, like men, determined to support their constitutional rights and property, in opposition to every act of violence under Heaven against them, take up arms, and are about to demand restitution of the powder, when they are dissuaded from such a step, by gentlemen in whom great confidence is placed, who persuade them to lay down their arms, and return to their respective homes; assuring them, at the same time, that every packsack endeavour should be made in order to have the powder replaced in the magazine. They then convened a common-hall, and in a very respectful manner address his lordship on the impropriety of his conduct in the affair of the powder, entreating him, at the same time, to return it again to the magazine, and thereby restore peace and order to the inhabitants of the town; to which said address his lordship was pleased to return a verbal answer (being, it is said, peculiarly happy in expressing his sentiments with ease and propriety that way) whereby it most evidently appears, that his lordship expressly avows the impropriety of his conduct in the removal of the powder, in promising, upon his "" word and honour ,"" that in case there should be an insurrection of the slaves , which he acknowledges there was cause to apprehend, he would then return the powder, on being allowed an half hour to do it in. The inconsistency of such an answer is so plain, that it needs no comment. In short, several gentlemen, who were dissatisfied with such an evasive, contradictory, and affrontive answer, wait on his lordship in person, and entreat him, as the representative of his majesty here, as the chief magistrate, and, above all, as a friend to peace and order, to return the powder, and thereby quiet the fears and apprehensions of the people; which he now positively refuses to do, assigning, as a reason for his strange and unwarrantable conduct, that the people of Williamsburg had been in arms. But attend to his subsequent conduct, and see if it accords with those pompons professions of regard for peace, order, and good government, and the happiness of the people (who are so unhappy as to be under his rule) which he would induce a belief are the grand objects of his care and study. Conscious that the people would no longer acquiesce in a behaviour in one moment so disingenuous and evasive, in another so disrespectful and irritating, he determined to sting off the mask, and bid defiance to their utmost efforts to regain the powder; and therefore immediately began to arm his menial servants, who were, by their lord and master's example, taught to look upon and treat the good people of this country with the greatest indignity and contempt. Add to all this, that we had just heard that many of our worthy and noble friends, the guardians and zealous supporters of our liberty, were on the black list of American victims, destined to sacrifice, in order to appease those sanguinary wretches in power; and that farther, we had received the long feared and melancholy news, that the sword was now drawn by the king's troops against our brethren the Bostonians, who were then bleeding in the common cause. Thus unhappily circumstanced on all sides, what does mr. Henry to deserve those in glorious epithets, which are, though obscurely, yet most certainly aimed principally at him, not only by his lordship's candid and liberal address to the Council, previous to the issuing of a former proclamation, but by those also in exalted station . Who it was hoped, from their affinity to our wrongs, and having received their birth there, would have entertained sentiments of a more generous and liberal kind of those who are the produce of the same country, and in loyalty and attachment to their gracious sovereign, not an iota, I trust, inferiour to them. I repeat, what does mr. HENRY (matters being thus situated) to deserve the censure of his countymen. Why, like the vigilant guardian and protector of their constitutional rights and liberties, he was resolved, with proper assistance, by the force of arms to effect a resistance, of the powder (or an equivalent thereto) which had been by low fraud and artifice removed out of the country's possession, and which he now was sorry to find pacifick measures were not likely to accomplish. This gentlemen, therefore, by the advice and determination of the Hanover committee, held at New-Castle the 2d instant, accompanied by many of his respectable and worthy countrymen, set out from Newcastle on their way to the Capitol, and were joined on their way down by several spirited gentlemen from different counties. With what prudence and penetration mr. Henry took his measures, and what they eventually produced, may be fully known by a reference to a publication of his conduct, at large, in moss. Dixon and Hunter's paper of the 13th instant; and as the matter stands represented there, and which is incontrovertibly consistent with the real truth of the case, how then does his lordship get his intelligence that this movement of mr. HENRY'S was to the great ""terrour of all his majesty's faithful subjects."" From whence does he learn that mr. HENRY had committed ""acts of violence."" Have any of those terrified ""faithful subjects,"" on whom those acts of violence were committed, preserved their complaint before his lordship, in order to obtain redress? Or are these words inserted only to heighten or aggravate this supposed guilty conduct of mr. HENRY'S, in the opinion of those who cannot be, in all probability, from the remoteness of their situation, furnished with an impartial and fair state of the case? The guilty, perhaps, might fear and tremble at an apprehension of the just vengeance of the incensed people, roused and provoked as they were by reiterated acts of oppression and tyranny; but whether the innocent Americans (of which I thank Heaven there is by far the greater majority) were terrified and frightened by this attempt, of mr. HENRY'S to regain their property, I leave the candid part of mankind to determine, from the publication of the proceedings of the many committees which have sat on this occasion, as may be seen in the papers subsequent to this step taken by mr. HENRY. Thus much, mr. Purdie, I have thought proper to lay before the publick, in vindication of the conduct of a gentleman, who is now absent, and, as the advocate and steady friend of his country, contending, I doubt not, for all that is precious and worth the preserving, to those who are by nature free, and who, by their laws and constitution, have an indubitable right to regain so, in opposition to every power to earth to make them otherwise.

Had his lordship, at this perplexed and unhappy conjuncture of affairs, steadily pursued that noble line of right which prudence and his duty had marked out to him, had he evinced from his actions, in accordance to his professions, that the happiness of the people which he ruled, was his great object and care; had he, like a good, virtuous, and great man, stepped in as a mediator in this unnatural struggle between Great Britain and her colonies, and attempted to close, rather than, by dissingenuous misrepresentations, to widen the breach; I trust he would still have continued to receive that grateful tribute of applause which the people here have, on some late occasions, so cordally offered up to him: But, from his late conduct, as held up to the world, what confidence can they place in him who has declared himself to be (and his actions manifest he is not in jest) their opposed and dangerous enemy?",blackUnrest

The following is a copy of the address of the Hon. House of Burgesses, at the last session of Assembly, which was transmitted to the Governor whilst he resided on board the FOWEY man of war, in answer to his Excellency's message inserted in this gazette of the 17th of JUNE

MY LORD,

THE House of Burgesses received your Lordship's written message of the 10th instant, in answer to the joint address of his Majesty's Honorable Council and this House, with equal concern and amazement. We were totally unprepared for so severe and cruel a return to the respectful application made to your Lordship, solely ducted by our duty to his Majesty, and the most earnest desire of contributing every thing in our power towards promoting, as well your Lordship's own happiness, as that of your Lady and whole family. This step, we hoped, would have proved the happy means of restoring that tranquility and harmony, you were pleased to flatter us with your earnest wishes to have established. Who were the peculiar objects of your tenderness, that you so kindly in favour to them, declined a particular enumeration, we know not, but are sorry that your Lordship had so little feeling for the honor, and integrity, of this House. Your have now, my Lord, driven us to the disagreeable necessity of inquiring minutely into the causes of the late disturbances in this country. It is not with the most distant inclination to give your Lordship the slightest umbrage that we engage in so irksome a task, but purely to do justice to our much injured country, that we recur to different, ands some distant, transactions. The charges of disloyalty and disaffection in our countrymen to our most gracious Sovereign, and his government, as insinuated in your Lordship's message, and some other public acts, are as grievous as they are unmerited. Words, we know, are too often but empty sounds. We appeal not to our processions, however sincere, but to facts, of public notoriety. The loyalty of this his Majesty most ancient colony stands concussed, as recorder by many of your worthy predecessors. We will presume to carry your attention no further back that to the administration of a Governor immediately preceding your Lordship. Previous to his coming over to Virginia, there has arisen some unhappy disputes between Great Britain and the colonies. His Majesty was graciously pleased to send over to us, from his immediate presence, the truly noble Lord BZOTETOURT, who told us, that he had received it in command from his Majesty to do justice, and maintain the rights of all his subjects. He cheerfully entered upon the duties of his exalted satin, in which he acted as a true representative of his royal master, at once supporting the dignity of his crown, dispensing the utmost justice, and diffusing benevolence throughout the country. By his exemplary conduct, in all respects, he accomplished what he deemed a glorious work; He gave us tranquillity, and happiness. Indeed he was often heard to declared, that the business of a Governor of Virginia was much easier than he could have conceived, as he found that the government almost executed itself. Matters were not yet that time carried on, and precipitated, with so high an hand, on the other side of the water, as at present. This probably was owing to his minutely examining every subject to the bottom himself, taking nothing upon trust; to his discountenancing tale-bearers, and malicious informers; and, at last, making a faithful representation of things, as he found them. In a short, too short a time, for the happiness of Virginia, it pleased God to remove him from us. When we received the account of your Lordship's appointment, we indulged the pleasing hopes that we should again be made happy in a ruler; and, when you were pleased to honour us with your presence, we vied with each other in endeavouring to make your administration easy and agreeable. Upon the report that your Lady and family were coming over to you, every one, we believe, who heard it, was eager in expectation of an event which was likely to give addition to your happiness. We received her Ladyship, and your children, with every expression of heart-felt joy, and have considered our countrymen as exceedingly happy in having such respectable pledges amongst them. Changes, my Lord, seldom happen without some sufficient cause. If, therefore, you have, or think you have, discovered any alteration in the sentiments or behaviour of those you preside over, it may be worth vour while, as well as ours, to search out the reason of it. Respect, my Lord, is not to be obtained by force, from a free people. If genuine, it must be a perfect volunteer; and nothing is so likely to ensure it to one in your station as dignity of character, a candid and exemplary conduct. We decline, on this occasion, a discussion of the subject unhappily in dispute between Great Britain and the colonies. We presume not to interfere with your authority in summoning or dissolving Assemblies, when, by advice of your Council, you think there is proper occasion. What we claim, as an act of justice, is, that our conduct should be fairly and impartially represented to our Sovereign. We do not mean to insinuate that your Lordship would, designedly, misrepresent facts; but it is much to be feared that you too easily give credit to some designing persons, who, to the great injury of this community, possess much too large a share of your confidence. We have seen, my Lord, the copy of a letter you were pleased to write to the Earl of Dartmouth, dated the 29th of May 1774. The design of then Assembly was entirely misconceived, and the ill impressions your Lordship's letter may have made on the minds of his Majesty, and his Ministers, prove how dangerous it is, and how very unjust it may be, to attempt penetrating the thoughts of others, when they are not certainly known. Suspicions, we humbly conceive, can never justify direct and positive accusations. Men, we know, differ in religious sentiments dome may believe in the superintendence of a providence, and that the care, especially of nations, is an object of Divine Goodness; whilst others may think, or affect to treat this, as well as other matters, which our religion teaches, as thing merely chimerical. We have likewise seen an authentic copy of extracts of another of your Lordship's Letters to the same noble Earl, dated the 24th of December 1774. The more injurious the unfavorable representations, contained in this letter, were likely to be to this country, the more careful we should have hoped your Lordship would have been in examining the evidences of the facts stated. Your Lordship had been pleased to represent, in the first letter, our House of Burgesses as fond of having it thought that a determined resolution to deny and oppose the authority of Parliament always originates with them. Whether this was intended to draw down the particular resentment of Parliament of this country, your Lordship can best determine. They have, indeed, protested against the power of Paliament, when they though it extended contrary to the principles of the constitution; but we do not know that they every affected to take the lead of the other colonies, in this, or any other measure. The times of entering their protestations were merely accidental, as circumstances happened; and it is notorious, that the subject of the present complaint had been under the consideration of some other colonies, before the Virginias took it up It would seem, form your Lordship's letter of the 24th of December, that the association adopted by the General Congress was first recommended from Virginia; whereas the truth is, that, in Virginia, nothing more was resolved against, at first, than the importation and use of East India commodities. The general non-export and non-import agreement came first recommended to us from several of the northern colonies. This, we own, makes no difference now, as the several colonies have united in the association. It is only remarked, since this circumstance seems to have been thought material, as no strong testimony of a kind disposition in your Lordship towards this country. That committees were chosen, in the several counties, is admitted. The design of them was to observe the conduct of those who were inimical to the interest of the country. They were required to publish the names of all transgressors, that the country might know their friends from their foes. This you were pleased to term ""inviting the vengeance of a lawless mob to be exercised upon the unhappy victims."" You further represented these committees as assuming an authority to inspect the books, invoices, and all the secrets of the trade and correspondence of merchants. This, my Lord, was high colouring of assumed facts; which we, who inhabit different parts of the country, are strangers to. To close your narrative upon this head, you were pleased to inform your noble correspondent, that every ""county in this colony was arming a company of ""men, whom they call an independent company, for the avowed ""purpose of protecting their committees, and to be employed ""against Government, if occasion require; and that the committee ""of one county had proceeded so far as to swear the men of ""their independent company to execute all orders which should ""be given them from their committee."" These, my Lord, are things entirely without our knowledge; and upon the strictest inquire, we are convinced they deserve no credit. There were a few companies of Gentlemen formed who were desirous of perfecting themselves in military exercise; but we find not more than six or seven throughout the whole colony, which consists of sixty one counties. This was designed to distinguish them from the militia at large; the first, and most considerable of these, was instituted for the better protection of the inhabitants of Norfolk borough, and afterwards received your Lordship's approbation, so far, that you expressed the warmest wishes that the example might be followed throughout the country, and gave commissions to their officers. That these companies were connected with the committees, or that they were ever designed to act against, or in any sort to interfere with, what you are pleased to call government, we do not, know, or believe, but, on the contrary, we are verily persuaded that they were always ready and willing to exert themselves to support the laws, and his Majesty's government, to the utmost of their power. Your Lordship's assertion, that the ""power of government was entirely disregarded, if not wholly ""overturned, and that there was not a justice of the peace in ""Virginia who acted except as a committee man,"" we cannot but consider as highly unjust, and extremely injurious to us. We have the greatest reason to believe, having it in full proof, that the magistrates throughout the colony duly attended their respective courts; and though, for the reasons assigned in our former address to your Lordship, they could not think themselves legally authorised to hear and determine civil suits, yet we are persuaded that their former endeavours to preserve the peace and good order of government were not interrupted, but exerted in the usual manner. The original cause of suspending the trials of civil disputes was, as your Lordship observes, the want of a see bill. This legal defect was, as your much lamented, and not used, that we know of, as a popular argument, by any man of good sense; nor did the inhabitants of this country join, in what your are pleased to call an opprobrious measure, to engage their"" English ""creditors to join the clam ours of this country. Your Lordship's assertion, that ""not a few did it to avoid paying their ""debts, in which many of the principal people here are much involved,"" we can only answer for ourselves in the negative; and must consider so indiscriminate a charge as extremely injurious. We were so far from desiring to do injustice to creditors, that it gave us great pain to observe that such a step was thought necessary; and nothing but the hopes of being relieved from the arbitrary system of colony government, attempted to be introduced, could have prevailed with us to submit to a stoppage of our exports. The merchants of London, in their written message, by a respectable member of their body, to the committee of the House of Commons, have done us ample justice in this respect; by representing, that they should have no uneasiness about remittances from America, unless Parliament pursued such means as were likely to prevent them. The Congress, my Lord, we consider as instituted on principles of public necessity; we do not deny our having a proper respect for that body; we learn, from good authority, that their humble and dutiful petition to his Majesty was graciously received, though, it is with concern, we are told it has hitherto produced no good effect: But that the inhabitants of Virginia treated with marks of reverence the laws of the Congress, ""which they never bestowed on their legal government, or ""the laws proceeding from it, is one of a great number of facts requiring proof; since we must take leave to say, with confidence, that his Majesty's subjects of Virginia have been second to none others, even to his dutiful and loyal subjects in any part of his wide-extended dominions, in all due respect to his government, Governors, and all in authority under him.

We cannot but remind your Lordship of the General Congress held in America, with the royal approbation, in the last war. The united interest indeed of Great Britain, and the colonies, might have then demanded it. In imitation of so laudable an example, America resolved on a like measure, as equally, if not more necessary, at this critical juncture. Your Lordship's account of the effects the association is likely to produce, considering it as a matter of opinion, we are little concerned to interfere with. Time only can discover the consequences of it; but your heavy charge against those called people of fortune, ""that they supply themselves and Negroes for two or three years, to the distresses of the middling and poorer sort,"" must have proceeded from your giving too easy credit to ill-founded reports. Some, but very few, may have supplied themselves, as opportunity offered, for the present year. This, we believe, is the most that has been done; and we are persuaded of a material mistake in another respect, it is being the general opinion, founded on good grounds, that the middling and poorer sort will fare much better than those of fortune, who have large numbers of slaves to provide for. Engaged on this topick, we cannot refrain from observing how strangely our views have been misrepresented. By the association, we intend nothing that is illegal; we are only resolved to be content with our home-spun manufacturers, however mean in quality, unless things can be restored to their former channel, the only security we desire for what we know our excellent constitution entitles us to. What your Lordship is pleased to represent as the arbitrary proceedings of the committees, we trust will produce none of those very dreadful effects you have painted in such alarming colours. The whole colony, very few excepted, is united: and, from such union of sentiments, expectations must be exceedingly sanguine, indeed, in supposing that discord will arise.

How the proceedings of the General Convention, in the month of March last, may have been represented, we know not; but, from the foregoing specimens, it is to be presumed in no very favourable light. These meetings, my Lord, unless it can be supposed that a whole country could entirely lose sight of its security and most essential interests, were rendered absolutely necessary, first by the dissolution, and afterwards by repeated prorogations, of the General Assembly. Upon inquiry into the state of the colony, it was found that there had been almost a total inattention to the proper training and disciplining of our militia. Various subsequent acts of our legislature, amendatory of the law of 1738, had expired; the act providing against invasions and insurrections was near expiring, and it was uncertain whether an opportunity would be given the General Assembly to revive it. Taking a further view of our situation, it was found that our inhabitants were exposed to the incursions of a barbarous and savage enemy. From the best accounts received from Great Britain, there was too much reason to be convinced that his Majesty's Ministry were prosecuting the most rigorous and arbitrary measures towards subjugating the whole continent of America to their despotic rule; which measures, it was more than probable, had been suggested from hence, and the other colonies: That a scheme, the most diabolical, had been meditated, and generally recommended, by a person of great influence, to offer freedom to our slaves , and turn them against their masters. The Convention, to guard against these dangers, not clearly seen into before that time, recommended a strict attention to the militia law of 1738; but, thinking this defective in many essential points, considering that, under this law, the whole militia were not obliged to exercise so frequently as might be necessary, it was recommended that volunteer companies should be formed in each county, for the better defence and protection of the whole country. These proceedings, according to an usual style, it is more than probable, have been represented as designed to oppose government; whereas, we are persuaded, that nothing was farther from the intentions of the Convention. A review of their resolutions must convince every unprejudiced mind that the utmost respect was paid to his Majesty and his legal government, and that the Convention had much pleasure in expressing their obligations to your Lordship for your late services. The truth is, my Lord, that his Majesty's dutiful subjects in this colony have the utmost attachment to their sovereign; they admire, they love the constitution, and will risk every thing most dear and valuable in support of it. These are principles imbibed in their infancy, and their constant care is to inculcate them inculcate them upon the minds of their children; they meditate or design nothing in the least offensive: But, if it is expected that they should sit down supinely, and submit to yokes which neither they nor their forefathers were able to bear, they must acknowledge that they have the sensibility and feelings of freemen, actuating them to a proper and justifiable defence of those rights which are guarantied by the laws and principle of the constitution.

We have, my Lord, made the strictest and minutest inquiry into the causes of the late disturbances. We find, firms the examination of many respectable merchants natives of Great Britain, residing in different part of this colony, and from other Gentlemen of character, that the country was in perfect state of tranquility till they received an account of your Lordship's removal of the gunpowder from the public magazine, to one of his Majesty's ships of war, and of your irritating and most unjustifiable threats.

The inhabitants of this country, my Lord, could not be strangers to the many attempts in the northern colonies to disarm the people, and thereby deprive them of the only means of defending their lives and property. We know, from good authority, that the like measures were generally recommended by the ministry, and that the export of power from Great Britain had been prohibited. Judge then how very alarming a removal of the small stock which remained in the public magazine, for the defence of the country, and the stripping the guns of their locks, must have been to any people, who had the smallest regard for their security. The manner, and time, of doing it, made no small addition to the general apprehension of your Lordship's views. The reason assigned by your Lordship for taking his step, we should have thought the most likely, at any other time, to have directed a very different conduct. We should have supposed, that a well-grounded apprehension of an insurrection of the slaves ought to have called forth the utmost exertions to suppress it. The world will probably judge your Lordship's method of doing this, the least likely to effect the necessary purpose. Your Lordship having represented this powder as the King's peculiar property, supposing it to have been brought from one of his ships, we have made inquiry into that matter, and cannot find that there ever was any powder brought either from the Rippon or any other man of war; so that we presume your Lordship must have been misinformed as to this fact, since the powder was removed, as it was not relied on in your answer to the address of the corporation of the city of Williamsburg. Be this, however, as it may, we conceive the case would not be materially altered. We must remind your Lordship, that, by a very ancient law of this country, enacted so long since as the thirty second year of the reign of his Majesty King Charles the second, for raising a public revenue; and for the better support of this government, amongst other provisions, an impost of one half pound of new gunpowder, and three pounds of leaden shot, or one shilling and three pence sterling, was imposed on all ships or vessels coming into this colony. In the ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne, the impost of one shilling and three pence on the tonnage of vessels was continued, for port duties. It is evident, my Lord, that the original and chief design of this particular impost was to provide, from time to time, a proper stock of munitions for the defence of the country. We have examined the produce of this fund for thirteen years past, and find that it yielded in that time twenty eight thousand five hundred and three pounds three shillings and ninepence sterling, which, on an average, amounted to 2192 l. . sterling per annum; and it is observable, that for the four last years it yielded considerably more than three thousand pounds in each year. It may from hence be fairly submitted, whether it was not incumbent on the executive part of government to have provided, in the first place, from so large and ample a fund, a proper stock of arms and ammunition, which was so essentially necessary for the security of the country. If, my Lord, instead of applying a reasonable part of this money to such necessary purposes, the whole has been applied to other occasions of government, and powder and arms had been procured through some other channel. we should presume that these. then stored in the public magazine, built at the expense of the country, and appropriated to the safekeeping of all military stores, ought there to have remained, till the exigencies of the country demanded them.

We find, my Lord, that the inhabitants of the city of Williamsburg, in the midst of which the magazine in situated, upon discovering that the powder was removed, the time and manner of its being done, in the dead of night, under an escort of armed marines, commanded by Capt. Henry Collins of the Magdalen, were exceedingly alarmed; that many of them were so exasperated that they had recourse to arms, intending, as we understand, to compel Capt. Collins to restore the powder; but we cannot discover that the least insult was intended to your Lordship. We find that the Corporation of Williamsburg presented a very decent and respectful address to your Excellency, desiring that you would be pleased to order the powder to be returned; and, on receipt of your verbal answer, amongst the other things, avowing that it had been removed by your orders, under which Capt. Collins had acted, and promising that it should be returned in case of an insurrection , the people assembled were soon appeased, returned quietly to their respective homes, and perfect tranquility was restored in the city; that in the succeeding night, on a report that a number of armed men had landed ad a ferry about four miles from the city, the inhabitants were again much alarmed; but, upon the interposition of some Gentlemen, they were quieted, and nothing farther was done than strengthening the usual patrol for the security of the city. We farther find, that on the next day, when every thing was perfectly quiet, your Lordship sent a message into the city by one of the magistrates, which you delivered with the most solemn asseverations, that if any insult was offered to Capt. Foy, or Capt. Collins, you would declare freedom to the slaves , and lay the town in ashes; and that you could easily depopulate the whole country. What could have provoked your Lordship to this we cannot discover, as both Captain Foy and Captain Collins, and several other officers, had been frequently seen walking publicly in the streets, and no one offered either of them the least injury; nor can we discover any reason to believe that any thing of the sort was intended. The inhabitants, my Lord, could not but be exceedingly alarmed at so cruel a threat; many people considered it as part of that general plan, they had heard was recommended in England, and which was discovered by your Lordship through accident; they however, did nothing more, that we can learn, than continue their former patrols. A report of these several matters having soon circulated throughout almost the whole country, with this addition, that the most valuable guns in the magazine had been striped of their locks, and that the inhabitants of Williamsburg were in the most imminent danger, the minds of the people in general were much agitated; they assembled in different quarters, and a number of express were sent to inquire and obtain a true state of things. It appears, that, during this general uneasiness, an account was received from the northward of the engagement at Concord; the General, it seems, had sent an armed force to seize a provincial magazine. This, your Lordship may suppose, increased the apprehension of our people, as it held out to them an additional proof that the steps you had taken formed a part of that general system adopted to render the colonies defenceless. If, upon such alarm, when the minds of the people were fretted to an extreme degree, some irregularities were committed, the cause may be found in those extraordinary attempts to stretch the powers of government so much beyond their ancient and constitutional limits. It gave the greatest concern, my Lord, to all acquainted with your most amiable Lady, and her distinguished character, to hear that she had removed with her children to ore of the King's ship. We have inquired into the cause of this; and though we do not presume to prescribe to her ladyship, yet we are persuaded, that, had she known the sentiments of all ranks of people in this colony, every uneasiness would have been removed. We find, my Lord, that from the great pains taken by the magistrates, and other inhabitants of the city of Williamsburg, there could have been no real ground for fear at the time of her Ladyship's removal, unless it was produced from your Lordship's threats, which might have kept the minds of some of the citizens in suspense. A few Ladies, it appears, left the city; but it was not through apprehensive of any other danger than what your Lordship held over them. The inhabitants certainly could have entertained no suspicious of injury from their friends in the country. Who had kindly offered to come to their assistance; so that it was in the power of your Lordship, alone, to have removed her Ladyship's uneasiness.

It gives us the greatest pain, my Lord, to find, in your Excellency's message, so determined a resolution to pursue a course the most likely to revive the uneasiness of the people, and prevent that restoration of harmony for ardently wished for by all good men. You are pleased to submit to our ""judgment, whether you could reasonably have expected any good effect from communicating the ground of your uneasiness to us."" We give it as our opinion, that your Lordship had the greatest reason, if you had viewed our conduct in its proper light, to have expected the best effects from such communication, as we met your Lordship in General Assembly with the sincerest dispositions to do every thing in our power to provide for the tranquility of the country. The reasons assigned for your contrary apprehensions, we are persuaded, must have been suggested to your Lordship by some designing, malevolent informer. We can hardly suppose your Lordship could have had any well-grounded fear of personal danger, when it is notorious that you appeared publicly, as usual; and it is in proof to us, that the same night in which you left the palace, you walked alone to the Attorney General's, at the distance of upwards of a quarter of a mile, and returned unmolested; and we cannot discover that even the slightest insult was offered. If you judge of the disposition of the House of Burgesses, as to public matters, from their declining to accept an invitation to dine with your Lordship (the instance of respect and civility alluded to, and which you say you had been forward in offering to them) you have entirely mistaken their motives. A piece of civility of this sort had formerly its due weight with us; but we have little reason to suppose that such a ceremony would, at this time, be attended, on your Lordship's part, with that cordiality which we thought we had observed on former occasions. How could your Lordship think of admitting to your table a set of men, whom, together with the whole body of their constituents, you had endeavoured to paint in such despicable and odious colours? That the House of Burgesses ever countenanced the violent and disorderly proceedings of the people, we must, in justice to ourselves, take leave to deny. As to the magazine's being rifled, which you are pleased to insinuate was done with the approbation of the House, we must say, that in this also the greatest injustice is done to us. The House was sitting, closely engaged in public business, when this affair happened. Some of our members, as we believe the truth is, upon hearing what was going forward at the magazine, went up in hopes of preventing it. We are informed, that a great concourse of people, from different parts of the country, were assembled, and that many of the arms had been taken out of the magazine. Several of the members, as Private Gentlemen, remonstrated with all the people they met with against such proceedings, and prevailed with them to return what they had taken. When your Lordship was pleased to accuse the House of Burgesses of usurping the ""executive power,"" from what happened on this occasion, we presume it would have been well to have considered with what propriety they could have interfered: Had they made an order for apprehending the persons concerned, who were unknown, it would have been fruitless, and, moreover, a plain departure from the line of their authority. Such a step your Lordship might, indeed, have justly censured, as an usurpation of the executive power. or would your Lordship have recommended to the individual members to have acted as bailiffs, in seizing all offenders they met with? We never have, nor will we ever give countenance to such unjuifiable proceedings as happened that day.

Your acquaintance, my Lord, with mankind, must suggest to you the difficulty there is in restraining an incensed multitude. Many people, the irritation of whose minds had but lately subsided, we understand, had been again greatly alarmed at a late unfortunate accident, which happened to some inconsiderate young men, in their unlawful attempt, my Lord, which we condemn as highly as your Lordship can. But whether some little apology may not be suggested, from that universal anxiety which all mankind have to prepare for the defense of their lives and property, we will not determine; the point is delicate, and we leave the world to judge of it. But the means contrived, in pursuance of your Lordship's orders, by which an unfortunate culprit might probably have been hurried into eternity, without a moment's time for reflection, we conceive, can do no great honour to humanity; which, we should have supposed, would have dictated the necessity of at least giving public that spring- guns were prepared and fixed; which, it is imagined, would have answered every purpose of security too the magazine. Your Lordship's reflections on our committee, and, through them, upon this whole House, we think might have been spared, after what passed early in the session. Had the committee misbehaved, we should not have been backward in taking proper notice of it.",blackUnrest

WE are highly pleased with the conduct of the people of South Carolina, who have taken the troops destined for Virginia from Saint Augustine, and think ourselves the more obliged to those brave Carolinians, as those troops were to have been a reinforcement to the sixty men who have been so very formidable to the towns of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Gosport. What might have been the consequence had they arrived! But to be serious: How long will the inhabitants of those towns suffer themselves to be so shamefully insulted by ld De and the captains of the men of war? To what is it owing that their committees have so unaccountably acquitted some late extraordinary delinquents? Is it to a want of zeal in the glorious cause, or of spirit to prosecute it? But we trust that the people of Norfolk will remove our doubts and jealousies, and wipe off every stain on their characters, by making a proper use of the golden opportunity Heaven has now afforded them. To do this nothing is requisite but a little spirit, with some address and ingenuity in the application of it. A number of small vessels may be easily fitted out as fire ships, and may be used with almost certainty of success, and without the least risk of lives on our part. Nor can the most loyal of his majesty's subjects condemn this measure, since it is but a proper chastisement of the most despicable tools of his greatest enemies; nor can humanity forbid it, because it is dictated by some of its first feelings, and honest indignation, and the love of our country, and is enjoined by the first law of nature.

When king, lords, and commons, have combined to enslave us; when a corrupt and abandoned parliament have voted their lives and fortunes at the service of a perfidious, cruel, and bloody administration, in the execution of their wicked plan; when, in consequence of this, fleets and armies are sent against us, which have pillaged our coasts, bombarded out towns, and but for the glorious intrepidity of our countrymen, under the particular favour and protection of the Almighty, would have spread desolation throughout our land; when we consider the damnable plot that has been laid against us of stirring up the Canadians and Indians to attack us on our frontiers, and our slaves and tories within the body of our country, whilst their fleets were to lay waste our costs; and when he have seen this plan recommended in a pamphlet written by an accursed petisioner, doctor Johnson, by the order of the minister, and under the particular patronage of the king; when we consider these things, who can hesitate a moment to declare that we ought to do all in our power to be revenged on such an administration, and to hurl down destruction on all the infernal tools? Let not our countrymen think that captain Macartney deserves more indulgence than captain Squire, on lord Dunmore: He, like captain Montague, has taken upon himself to interfere with the civil power, has impudently supposed that his presence could awe a committee, and protect a culprit, and has wickedly threatened to fire on a defenceless town. But let captain Macartney know, that whenever he lands in Virginia he is amenable to the laws of Virginia, which may punish him as a trespasser, rioter, or murderer, or as a rebel, if he should, like ld De and Squire, attempt to raise an insurrection ; and we would have all those tools of government to know, that, whenever they return to England, we shall try the full force of the English laws against all such offences as they have or shall commit here.

extorted from the people
of Norfolk and Princess
Anne, by lord Dunmore.
WE the inhabitants ofbeing
fully sensible of the errors and
guilt into which this colony
hath been misled, under colour
of seeking redress of
grievances, and that a set of
factious men, stiling
themselves committees,
conventions, and congress,
have violently, and under
various pretences, usurped the
legislative and executive
powers of government, and are
thereby endeavouring to
overturn our most happy
constitution, and have incurred
the guilt of actual rebellion
against our most gracious
sovereign: We have therefore
taken an oath abjuring their
authority, and solemnly
promising, in the presence of
almighty God, to bear faith and
true allegiance to his sacred
majesty George the third; and
that we will, to the utmost of
our power and ability, support,
maintain, and defend, his
crown and dignity, against all
traitorous attempts and
conspiracies whatsoever. And
whereas armed bodies of men
are collected, in various parts
of this colony, without any
legal authority, we wish them
to be informed, that however
unwilling we should be to shed
the blond of our countrymen,
we must, in discharge of our
duty to God and the king, and
in support of the constitution
and laws of our country, oppose
their marching into this county,
where their coming can answer
no good end, but, on the
contrary, must expose us to the
ravages and horrors of a civil
war; and, for that purpose, we
are determined to take
advantage of our happy
situation, and will defend the
passes into our county, and
neighbourhood, to the last drop
of our blood.
Lord Dunmore's cruel policy
begins at length to be
discovered by the blacks, who
have lately deserted from him
to a considerable number.
When his lordship first went
down to Norfolk he gave great
encouragement to unwary
negroes, but, such was his
baseness, some of them, it is
confidently said, he sent to the
West Indies, where these
unfortunate creatures were
disposed of to defray his
lordship's expences; and others,
such as he took any dislike to,
he delivered up to their
masters, to be punished. Since
the troops under colonel
Woodford's command began
their march, lord Dunmore
issued a proclamation inviting
the of rebels, as he is pleased to
say, to repair to land. A
considerable number at went to
him, but upon their masters
taking the man of allegiance,
they were immediately told
they must return. Some
runaways, however, remained,
but these were kept constantly
employed in digging in wet
ground, till at length the
seventy of their labour forced
many of them to fly. Those that
were left behind have made
several attempts to get off, but
such is the barbarous policy of
this cruel him, he keeps these
unhappy creatures not only
against their will, but intends to
place them in the front of the
battle, to prevent their flying, in
case of an engagement, which,
from their utter ignorance of
fire arms, he knows they will
do.
A correspondent sent us the
following, which, as there is
something remarkable in the
exploit, we have thought proper
to give it a place: ""A few days
ago, Mr. Thomas Archer,
junior, of York, being in
company with some gentlemen
in that place, they discovered a
duck in the river, which was
deemed upwards of 240 yards
from the shore, the
conversation then happened to
be on the excellence of our
rifles, Mr. Archer said he
believed he could kill it with
his riffle, notwithstanding the
greenness of the distance. He
received, and shortly after
brought his gun. He then fired,
and favoured the head of the
duck from its body."" If
beheading would not be doing
too much honour, we could
heartily with that pirate
Dunmore had shared a like fate,
instead of the inoffensive owl.
But alas! such a Negro, such a
daging deserves no other end
than the most ignominious of
culprits, the and the gibbet.
From a correspondent. Twenty
men just returned from off
guard made, application to
colonel Scott for liberty to fire
their wet guns at lord
Dunmore's entrenchment,
which he granted, not thinking
they intended it in reality. They,
however, advanced within 70
yards of the entrenchment, and
began to fire their rifles, which
the enemy returned, with the
loss of one man on our side,
belonging to captain Parker's
company. The fire was kept up
on both sides for two hours; our
men then retreated, and brought
off their dead man with them. It
is supposed that some of the
enemy are killed, as the
riflemen had many fair shoots
at them.
One of Dunmore's tenders
lately went to a place called
Mulberry Island, in Warwick
county, and landed her men,
who went to Mr. Benjamin
Wells's house, with their faces
blacked like negroes, whose
dear companions they are, and
robbed from thence all his
household furniture, four
negroes, a watch, and stock-
buckle. The inhuman wretches
even took the bed on which
several sick infants were
reposing.
Connelly, with Smith and
Campbell, we understand, were
lately taken at Hagar's Town, in
Maryland. These fellows have
long been in confederacy with
Dunmore. Many letters were
found on them from him,
advising them to procure all the
Indians, negroes, and whiles,
they possibly could against
Christmas day, in order to meet
him at Alexandria.
Eleven negroes are now in the
great gaol in this city for
attempting to get to lord
Dunmore. They were
discovered making off in boats,
when our people attacked them,
and wounded two, one it is
thought mortally. They made
very little resistance.

LET no man be dismayed at being proclaimed a Rebel ; let every such person know, that lord Dunmore has no right to declare any man so who has not been legally convicted, and that he himself may be sued and indicted for such proceedings. Whoever consider, well the meaning of the word Rebel will discover that the author of the proclamation is now himself in actual rebellion , having armed our slaves against us, and having excited them to an insurrection ; for which, by the laws of the land, they forfeit their lives. And let it be remembered, that there is a treason against the state , for which such men as lord Dunmore , and even kings , have lost their heads . Let it be remembered, that the king and his governour's are bound by the laws , as much as his subjects; and that no man can be condemned or punished who is not found guilty by a jury of his county, nor legally prosecuted for disobeying the arbitrary mandates of a tyrant . We have taken up arms, it is true; but this we have an undoubted right to do, in defence of the British constitution, of that very constitution which the present royal family was brought in to support, and on the principles of the glorious revolution, those very principles which alone could give our king a right to the throne of England. We are therefore contending not only for our privileges as freemen, but for the support of the British constitution; and if we are supporting that, we are supporting our king, and on the only sure ground on which he can be supported. The present ministry and rebels and traitors to their prince ; they are endeavouring to make him forfeit his crown. The earl of Dunmore, late governour, may be called a genuine rebel . His father was in two rebellions , strictly and properly so called; and he is now himself engaged in one of a more artful and dangerous nature, and he has the effrontery to shift the odious charge on us. If there are loyal subjects in the world, they are in America; they are in Virginia. But enough of this. Independent of these arguments, my countrymen, we may urge, that we have a right to take up arms in self-defence, since we have been threatened with an invasion of savages , and an insurrection of slaves , and have had our negroes and stocks priatically taken from us. The laws of God and nature , and the principles of the constitution , justify it; and, at present, all the feelings of humanity, every suggestion of policy, and the cries of our insulted and imprisoned countrymen, loudly call you TO ARM.",blackUnrest

By the REPRESENTATIVES of the PEOPLE of the colony and dominion
of VIRGINIA, assembled in GENERAL CONVENTION.

A DECLARATION.

WHAREAS Lord Dunmore, by his proclamation, dated on board the ship William, the 7th day of November 1775, hath presumed, in direct violation of the constitution, and the laws of this country, to declare marital law in force, and to be executed throughout this colony, whereby our lives, our liberty, and property, are arbitrarily subjected to his power and direction; and whereas the said Lord Dunmore, assuming power which the King himself cannot exercise, to intimidate the good people of this colony into a compliance with his arbitrary will, hath declared those who do not immediately repair to his standard, and submit in all things to a government not warranted by the constitution, to be in actual rebellion, and thereby to have incurred the penalties inflicted by the laws for such offences; and hath offered freedom to the servants and slaves of those he is pleased to term rebels , arming them against their masters, and faithful subjects, whose property is rendered insecure, and whose lives are exposed to the dangers of a general insurrection ; We, as guardians of the lives and liberty of the people our constituents; conceive it to be indispensably our duty to protect them against every species of despotism, and to endeavour to remove those fears with which they are so justly alarmed.

If it were possible the understanding of men could be so blinded thatevery gleam of reason might be lost, the hope his Lordship says he hath over entertained of an accommodation between great Britain and this colony might now pass unnoticed; but truth, justice, and common sense, must ever prevail, when facts can be appealed to in their support. It is the peculiar happiness of this colony that his Lordship can be traced as the source of innumerable evils, and one of the principal causes of the misfortunes under which we now labour. A particular details of his conduct since his arrival in this colony can be considered only as a repetition, it having been already fully published to the world by the proceedings of the General Assembly, and a former Convention; but the unremitting violence with which his Lordship endeavours to involve this country in the most dreadful calamities constantly affords new matter for the attention of the public, and will remove every imputation of ingratitude to his Lordship, or of injustice to his character. His Lordship is pleased to ascribe the unworthy part be hath taken against this colony to a necessity arising from the conduct of its inhabitants, whom he hath considered in a rebellious state, but who known nothing of rebellion except the name. Ever zealous in support of tyranny, he hath broken the bonds of society, and trampled justice under his feet. Had his Lordship been desirous of effecting an accommodation of these disputes, he hath had the most ample occasion of exerting both his interest and abilities; but that he never had in view any such salutary end most evidently appears, from the whole tenour of his conduct. The supposed design of the Canada bill having been to draw down upon us a meless and savage energy, the present maneuvers amongst the Italian Catholics in Ireland, and the schemes concerted with D Conlly, and other vile instruments of tyranny, which have appeared by the examination of the said Connelly, justify the supposition, and most fully evince, his Lordship's inimical and cruel disposition towards us, and can best determine whether we have been wrong in preparing to resist, even by arms, that system of tynny adopted by the Ministry and Parliament of Great Britain, of which he is become the rigid executioner in this colony. The many, depredations committed also upon the inhabitants of this colony, by the tenders and other armed vessels, employed by his Lordship for such purposes, the pilfering and plundering the property of the people, and the actual seduction and seizure of their slaves , were truly alarming in their effects, and called aloud and resistance. The persons of many of our peaceable brethren have been seized and dragged to confinement contrary to the principles of liberty, and the constitutions of our country. Yet have born this injurious treatment with unexampled patience, unwilling to tried the blood of our fellow subjects; who, prosecuting the measures of a British Parliament, would sacrifice our lives and property to a relentless fury, and unabating avarice. If a Governor can be authorized, even by Majesty itself, to annual the laws of the land, and introduce the most execrable systems, the law marital; if, by his single fiat he can strip us of our property, can give freedom to our servants and slaves , and arm them for our destruction; let us bid adieu to every thing valuable in life, let us once bend our neck to the galling yoke, and hug the chains prepared for us and our latest posterity!

It is with inexpressible concern we reflect upon the distressed situation of some of our unhappy countrymen who have thought themselves too immediately within the power of Lord Dunmore , and have been induced thereby to remain inactive. We lament the advantages be hath taken of their situation, and at present impute their inactivity, in the cause of freedom and the constitution, not to any defection or want of zeal, but to their defenseless state; and whilst we endeavour to afford them succour, and to support their rights, we expect they will contribute every thing in their power to effect their deliverance. Yet, if any of our people, in violation of their faith plighted to this colony, and the duty they owe to society, shall be found in arms, or continue to give assistance to our enemies, we shall think ourselves justified, by the necessity we are under, in executing upon them the law of retaliation.

Impressed with a just and ardent zeal for the welfare and happiness of our countrymen, we trust they will, on their part, exert themselves in defense of our common cause, and that we shall all acquit ourselves like freemen, being compelled, by the disagreeable, but absolute necessity, of repelling force by force , to maintain our just right and privileges; and we appeal to GOD, who is the sovereign disposer of all events, for the justice of our cause, trusting to his unerring wisdom to direct our councils, and give success to our ARMS.

And to the end that all such who have taken this unlawful and wicked step, may return in safety to their duty, and escape the punishment due to their crimes, we hereby promise pardon to them, they surrendering themselves to Col.
