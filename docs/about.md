This website highlights the findings and arguments explored in Chloe Zehr's M.A. thesis, "Phrasing Insurrection: A Computational Study of the Grammars of Collective Enslaved Resistance in the South Carolina Gazette and Virginia Gazette between 1732 and 1775," completed in Fall, 2024, at the University of Colorado Boulder. This study investigated how digital methods, such as text mining and computational corpus linguistics, can inform novel research questions and approaches to what we can know about white colonial conceptions of collective enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century. Moreover, this research calls into question how the grammars of colonial response were mutually constituted alongside the rise of hereditary racial slavery in colonial North America.

Chloe started her MA in the Fall of 2022. Their research focused on eighteenth and nineteenth-century enslaved resistance and the reconstruction of those histories in the twentieth century. Pairing traditional archival methodologies with digital methods such as computer programming, digital storytelling, and mapping Chloe's work attempts to address deeper contextualizations of enslaved resistance, especially as early Black intellectuals retold those histories in the early twentieth century. Chloe earned their B.A. in History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where they primarily studied how enslaved resistance informed gendered constructs of Black femininity in the Caribbean.
