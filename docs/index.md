This study explores how digital methods like text mining and computational corpus linguistics can inform new research questions about white colonial conceptions of collective enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century. It calls for interdisciplinary approaches to critically examine how language, like numeracy, reinforced hereditary racial slavery in early American history. 

> “Language, incontestably, reveals the speaker. Language, also, far more dubiously, is meant to define the other—and, in this case, the other is refusing to be defined by a language that has never been able to recognize him. People evolve a language in order to describe and thus control their circumstances, or in order not to be submerged by a reality that they cannot articulate. (And, if they cannot articulate it, they are submerged.)”  
> — James Baldwin, “If Black English Isn’t a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?” (1979)

This thesis re-examines colonial newspapers’ coverage of enslaved resistance, using text data from the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* between the 1730s and 1770s to investigate how black unrest intersected with grammar. Computational analysis of grammatical features, alongside slave trade data and colonial legislation, uncovers how colonial rhetoric shaped conceptions of enslaved resistance. Digital methods highlight linguistic patterns in newspaper reports on enslaved resistance, offering insight into the social and psychological processes that sustained racial slavery. This research engages with postcolonial scholarship, data science, data feminism, computational linguistics, literary studies, and digital humanities. By analyzing colonial grammar in reports of enslaved resistance, this thesis illustrates how collective actions by enslaved individuals shaped white socio-linguistic strategies. Even with limited text data, digital methods reveal broader patterns in how the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* portrayed resistance over time.

Jo Guldi asks:  
> “What is the fit between the methods of data science, the questions of philosophy, and the historical records that we have today?”  

This project acknowledges that computational methods are not final or exhaustive but offer new ways to analyze historical records. Counting words like “rebellious” risks reinforcing oppressive structures, but within historical inquiry, these methods illuminate how language was wielded by colonial authors to control narratives. In 2014, Katherine McKittrick urged scholars to rethink the black archival presence:  
> “The slave’s status as object-commodity... reveals that a black archival presence not only enumerates the dead and dying, but also acts as an origin story.”  

This project applies digital history to “count it out differently,” using text analysis to historicize black resistance’s influence on colonial language. It demonstrates how data reflects not just “what happened” but also “what else happened.” By analyzing the grammar used by white enslavers, ship captains, and planters, this study uncovers how language diminished black agency. Patterns of omission made visible through computational methods reveal how enslaved resistance disrupted colonial narratives. The scholar Jennifer Morgan aptly describes data as “the prisons of meaning enslaved people struggled against.”  

This project shows that computational methods can highlight these patterns, but context remains essential. Small datasets on slavery and resistance require historical interpretation. Historians, skilled in contextual analysis, are uniquely positioned to apply data science to uncover hidden narratives. While this study focuses on regional representations of enslaved resistance, it raises broader questions: How did enslaved black women feature in colonial reports? How did Northern and Southern colonial responses differ? How did subsequent revolutions reshape the language of black political violence? How did African American newspapers later adapt these grammars? The language of colonial newspapers persists today, shaping media portrayals of protest and reinforcing systemic injustices. Nathan Robinson highlights how passive voice remains:  
> “the favorite rhetorical tool of propagandists worldwide, who ‘regret the mistakes that were made’ without having to admit who made them.”  

This research acts as a reminder that by engaging with interdisciplinary methods to locate the consolidations and adaptations of the grammars of colonial response, we can chart—and further dismantle—the structural legacies of colonial newspapers’ representations of black political violence.
