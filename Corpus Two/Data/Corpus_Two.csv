The Virginia Gazette,1,William Parks,"Williamsburg, Virginia",1737_04_08,"April 8, 1737",1737,intended insurrection,Antigua and Barbuda,unknown,"In one of our Gazettes,
we gave an Account of a
Plot of the Slaves, against
the white People in
Antigua; and we have
now the following more
particular Account, viz.
Extract of a Letter from
Antigua, Oct. 24.
'Here has been a general Stop
to all Business, occasioned by
the happy Discovery of an
accused Negro Plot, which
should have been perpetrated
on the 11th Instant, the
Anniversary of the King's
Coronation, on which Day the
General usually gives a
handsome Ball to the
Gentlemen and Ladies of the
whole Island; but this was
postpon'd 'till the 30th Instant,
upon Account of the Death of
the General's Son at St.
Christophers some little Time
ago: This was the only
Preservative to all our Lives.
The Plot was thus, viz. One
Court, a Negro Man belonging
to Thomas Kirby, Esq; was the
chief Person in this Affair;
Tomboy, a Negro Man
belonging to Mr. Thomas
Hanston; and Hercules, a
Negro Man belonging to Mr.
John Christophers, were to
have been this King Courts
head Generals; and while the
Gentlemen and Ladies were
diverting themselves at the
Ball, which was to have been
held at Mr. Christopher
Dunbar's new House, they were
to convey a great Quantity of
Gun-powder into the Cellar,
and blow the House up: At the
same Time, this King Court,
Tomboy, and Hercules, were to
head a Party of Font Hundred
Men each; one from the East
End of the Town, one from
Otter's Pasture, and one from
Morgan's Pasture, all armed
with Cutlasses, and to fall on
all the Whites in the Town,
Men, Women, and Children,
without Reserve, at the same
Time the House blew up, which
was to be a general Signal to
the other Parts of the Island,
(for they were to place
themselves, or at least look out
on several Eminencies, which,
with a false Fire they were to
make at each Place) was to
convey the Signal through the
Island; then the Negros of each
Plantation were to rise and
destroy all the Whites in their
respective Districts, and so
have made themselves sole
Masters of the Island. How this
happy Discovery was made, is
hardly to be accounted for but
some kind Hand of Providence
induc'd the Magistrates to
enquire more strictly into their
Proceedings than usually they
had done, for playingatDice,
&c. which was contrary to the
wholesome Laws of this Island,
they still discover'd more and
more, till at last this Court,
Tomboy, and Hercules being
suspected, for former Crimes
and high Misdemeaners, were
taken up, and after some strict
Examination, found sufficient
Cause to commit them; and still
more and more Evidences
appearing against them, they
were at length convicted on the
19th Instant at Night. The Day
following, King Court was
brought to the Place of
Execution, there was laid
extended on a Wheel, seiz'd by
the Wrists and Ancles, and so
laid basking in the Sun for the
full Space of an Hour and a
Quarter, or more, when he
begg'd Leave to plead; to which
the Justices gave their Assent,
and be acknowledged every
Thing that was alledged against
him, and what his General
Tomboy had confess'd in Prison
the same Morning, when he
was affor'd his Time drew near
for Execution. At last about
Noon, Mr. King Court (for so
they had actually made him,
and bowed the Knee to him at a
very great Feast they had a
little before the Day they
intended to prosecute their
accurs'd Design) was broke on
the Wheel, and his Kingly Cap
and Canopy was found in some
Negro's Possession; Tomboy
was broke on the Wheel on
Thursday, and Hercules on
Friday; their Bones were broke,
and after, their Heads were cut
off, and stuck up on a Pole of
some considerable Height. Four
more of the Heads of these
honest Gentlemen were burnt
the same Dav in Otter's Pasture,
and To-morrow will be Seven
more, and so many as they can
find leading Men in this Plot.
This is all I can say to the
Affair at present, only that it
puts us all into the utmost
Confusion; all our People are
under Arms, and 'tis believed
will continue so till after
Christmas.","Antigua conspiracy; uses the term ""plot"""
The Virginia Gazette,1,William Parks,"Williamsburg, Virginia",1737_05_20,"May 20, 1737",1737,intended insurrection,Antigua and Barbuda,unknown,"Boston, March 15. We have an
Account from Antigua, That
there has been 60 Negroes
executed there, on Account of
their late Conspiracy; that
many of the Executions were
by Burning, and the Rack,
which many of them endured
with Obduracy. Four of these
Wretches were hung upon
Gibbets in Irons, in a
Quadrangle, so that they cou'd
see and speak to one another;
and they blamed themselves for
not putting their intended
Design in Execution sooner:
One of these was taken down,
on his Promise of making great
Discoveries, after he had
endured his Torments to the
Seventh Day; but when he was
nurs'd up, was as stubborn as
ever; and for that Reason
suffered a second Time. Among
those that were burnt, there was
one Grey with Age, that had
but one Leg. The Number of
those yet to be tried, may be
partly conjuctur'd; for there
were Forty add confin'd on
Board of Capt. Sulliff's Vessel,
for want of Prison room. One
of those miserable Creatures,
during his Confinement, by
some Means or other got a
Knife; but being handeuff'd and
pion'd so as not able to come at
his Throat, stbb'd himself in 7
or 8 Places; but the Pain of his
Wounds caus'd him to make
some unusual Noise, whereby
he was discover'd. and
immediately brought to the
Wheel and broke. On the Day
of Capt. Davis's Departure,
Two Free Negroes were
brought to their Trial, whose
Estates are suppos'd to be
worth 2000l. each. The People
are much harrass'd with
Watching; for it comes to every
White Man's Turn to be on his
Guard, and exercise his Arms.
once in 4 Days.
By the Report of the
Gentlemen appointed by the
Governor and Council of
Antigua, to examine into the
Affair of the said Conspiracy, it
appears, That after the
Execution of 12 of the chief
Conspirators, frequent Saturday
Nights Meetings of great
Numbers if Conspirators, had
been for a great while held at
several Places; and that by
drinking a Health in Rum, or
some other Liquors, mixt with
Grave Dirt, and sometimes
Cocks-blood infused, an Oath
of Secrecy and Fidelity had
been taken by many Hundred
Slaves, whereof the Words
were various; but the Tenor was
to stand by and be true to each
other, and to kill the Whites,
Man, Woman, and Child; to
assist in the Execution of this
when called upon by the
Chiefs, and to suer Death,
rather than discover.",Antigua conspiracy

Extract of a Letter from on
board the Squirrel Man of
War, at Charles Town, to a
Gentleman in Boston.
I Let you know, that we have
had the Fortune of taking about
3 Weeks ago, off St. Augustine,
a Spanish Vessel, the Crew
consisting of 9 Men; her Cargo
was Flour, Butter, &c. which
they had bought of Capt. Kip,
of New-York, who is there at
Present, but dares not venture
out, for fear of being made a
Prize. Our Prize had also on
board 700 Ounces of Silver:
Our Captain has used the
Spanish Crew with the utmost
Humanity. We arriv'd here
about Week ago with the Prize;
& shall sail again on another
Cruise in about 10 Days, with
Two or Three Men of War. We
have News, that General
Oglethorpe is going with a
great Army both of Soldiers
and Indians, to take St.
Augustine: This Day our
Captain had a Letter from him,
which was sent with all
possible Haste; which I
suppose is for us to dispatch for
that Place. The rebellions
Negroes are quite stopt from
doing any further Mischief,
many of them having been put
to the most cruel Death, as
Examples to others. The yellow

informs us that an insurrection
of the Negroes has happened at
the island of Grenada, where a
body of them, to the number of
six or seven hundred, who had
chiefly deserted from the
French inhabitants, had taken
possession of some
inaccessible mountains, from
whence they made frequent
sallies, and committed terrible
devastations upon their master,
many of whom they had killed.

General Melvil had sent a party
of 40 men, with one cohorn, to
endeavour to suppress them,

The Chilestans are the bravest People on the Continent, and ever had a most remarkable Antipathy to the Spaniards, which made them cautious how they trusted the Natives, who have before made Attempts to recover their lost Liberties, but were always subdued, by the Spaniards keeping Possession of the Coasts. The Insurrection that lately happened began at the Town of Baldivia, or Valdivia, where the Gold Mines are situated. It was thus: On the Night of the 14th of May a Body of near ten Thousand Indians came to the Mines, and sell up in the Guards, whom they murdered; they then proceeded to set free the Negroes, but slaughtered all the Whites they came near without Mercy. After this Action they proceeded to the Town, but found the People were alarmed, and had made some Preparations, having shut the inner Gates, and pointed some Guns on the Walls, which they fired incessantly on the Indians, and did great Execution. Finding themselves not able to gain Possession of the inner Town, they set Fire to the Suburbs, and burnt them to the Ground, in which were three fine Churches, an Hospital, and several religious Houses. Having vented their Fury as far as in their Power at Valdivia, and being joined by a Number of Indian and Negro Slaves that dwelt in the Suburbs, they left a Guard to prevent the Spaniards from escaping out of the Town, and proceeded immediately to the Town of Imperial, which they invested, but were obliged to raise the Siege with Precipitation. They marched of as if they intended to serve Villaria in the same Manner. A Vessel was immediately sent from Imperial with Intelligence; and, when the Advices came away for Madrid, an Officer was preparing to march out of Lima at the Head of four Thousand Men.""","also printed in South Carolina Gazette, mentions enslaved negros joining an insurreciton alongside other participants"

Advice is received from Honduras Bay, dated the 29th of May last, that the Day before the Inhabitants at St. George's Key were alarmed with an Account of an Insurrection having happened among the Negroes in the Old River, which broke out amongst the Slaves belonging to Walter Davidson, who, when the Accounts came away, had murdered two white Men, and being powerful in Number, were proceeding to the next Mahogany Works, to invite or force the Slaves to Join them. A Number of Inhabitants, joined to a Detachment of Sailors from the Diligence Man of War, properly victualled and armed, are just now preparing to set of in Quest of the Revolvers. Every Person possessed of Families and Property in the different Rivers is obliged to quit the Keys, and proceed thither. Such Negroes as are suspected on this Key were last Night taken up, and confined on Board the Man of War. Every Precaution is taken to prevent any farther Disorder, and it is hoped the Insurrection will, with the Blessing of God, be subdued in a Short Time.

""I am extremely concerned at the Measures pursuing by Great Britain against the Colonies, for poor Boston in particular. It could never be meant that the was to be the sole Butt of their—I will call no harsh Names. The rest of the Colonies were in full Perspective. Gradual in Execution, was the most probable Means of gaining and Establishing a Precedent. The Capital subdued to Obedience would have been sufficient, to every Purpose. By Obedience, I mean Obedience to the extraordinary new Mandates; and I can assure you that but few who know the interest of the English Carihbee Island but must, and do, approve the Measures adopted by the Town of Boston. It cannot be conceived by you, on the Continent, what a Confusion the Suspension of Supplies to the Island would occasion. Insurrections among the Negroes must be the Inevitable Consequence. Hunger is, and ever will be, a Means to drive Men upon every practicable Means to appease its Gnawings. The Islands formerly raised Negro Provisions, such as Tams, Potatoes, and India Corn, nearly sufficient for each Plantation, and had from North America the Remainder, but the Grounds so appropriated have of late Years been constantly improved in Canes, as more profitable; and the Food brought from the Colonies being not only cheaper, but more solid and agreeable in Taste, the withdrawing in from the Slaves, now accustomed to it, would be sufficient to breed a Mutiny throughout the Estates. The Property of many of these Estates, improved by their A gents, and stocked with from 2 to 7 or 800 Negroes, residing in many of the leading Men in London, Bristol, and other capital Seaports, interest would render them your Advocates, rather than suffer such immense Fortunes to run to Ruin.

""In short, a suspension of Supplies would oblige the Planters to discontinue the Culture of Canes, and it could by no Means be speedily recovered. The Islands cannot subsist for any Time without Provisions from the Continent, and sew indeed of the inhabitants are there but already Groan with Apprehension that the dreaded Suspension may take Place.

""I should conceive a second Consideration would draw the Attention of those Gentlemen to the common Welfare, viz. the French King's Death, and the Measeres that Nation are taking in their Islands. It is not six Months since several Troops arrived at Martinico and Guadaloupes which are distributed in. Reinforcements to their Garrisons. A Continuance or Renewal of this Police has very lately taken Place. About eight Days ago a Brig landed 100 fresh Troops at Port Royal, and then proceeded to St. Domingo. The French say 900 more are on their Passage for same Place, in different Vessels. Their Artisans are all employed on Fortresses, adding and repairing; and many new Batteries and Redoubts are erecting in a Private Manner, even where no probable Service, by Prevention to Land, can be expected them. In their gasconading Way, they are very soon to conquer much of America, as well as these Island. War seems planning in Martinico, I hope no Where else in this critical Conjuncture. God only knows what would be the Event. Their several Preparations are unaccountable. I wish all Matters were reconciled led, to be in Readiness for what may happen""

By captain Lovett, arrived last week in this Town after a short Passage to Portsmouth from Antigua, we learn that the Merchants and Planners were in great Consternation there on reading the proposals of the Colonies for suspending their supplies of Lumber and provisions, which they agree much be ruinous to them; and in consequence, they have appropriated a Third of their Cane plantation for the culture of Indian Corn, Yams, Potatoes, &c. for the Maintenance of their Slaves , in Cafe the Suspension does take place. It is father said Antigua has sent home a Remonstrance on that Head, praying Great Britain either to open the port of Boston, and let them have provisions as usual, or furnish them with the absolute Necessaries of Life themselves; otherwise, they, their Sugar-planting must speedily come to an End, as they can neither support their Slaves , nor ship the Sugars home, for Want of casks. Notwithstanding the Distress in which they foresee they must be involved by our Discontinuance of Trade with them, they generously commend us for the Resolutions, acknowledging that in our circumstances any Measure we can hold on for Relief from the chains imposing upon us is fully justifiable.

WE his Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and Common Council of the city of Williamsburg, in common hall assembled, humbly beg leave to represent to your Excellency, that the inhabitants of this city were this morning exceedingly alarmed, by a report that a large quantity of gunpowder was, in the preceding night, while they were sleeping in their beds, removed from the publick magazine in this city, and conveyed under an escort of marines on board one of his Majesty's armed vessels lying at a ferry on James river.
We beg leave to represent to your Excellency, that as this magazine was erected at the publick expense of this colony, and appropriated to the safe keeping of such ammunition as should be there lodged form time to time for the protection and security of the country, by arming thereout such of the militia as might be necessary in cases of invasions and insurrections , they humbly conceive it to be the only proper repository to be resorted to in times of imminent danger.

We farther beg leave to inform your Excellency, that from various reports, at present prevailing in different parts of the country, we have too much reason to believe that some wicked and designing persons have instilled the most diabolical notions into the minds of our slaves , and that therefore the utmost attention to our internal security is become the more necessary.

The circumstances of this city, my Lord, we consider as peculiar and critical. The inhabitants, from the situation of the magazine, in the midst of their city, have for a long tract of time been exposed to all those dangers which have happened in many countries from explosions, and other accidents. They have, from time to time, thought it incumbent on them to guard the magazine. For their security, they have for some time past judged it necessary to keep strong patrols on foot: In their present circumstances, then, to have the chief and necessary means of their defence removed, cannot but be extremely alarming.

Considering ourselves as guardians of the city, we therefore humbly desire to be informed by your Excellency upon what motives, and for what particular purpose, the powder has been carried off in such a manner, and we earnestly entreat your Excellency to order it to be immediately returned to the magazine.",diabolical notions in slaves

WHEREAS there is too much reason to suppose that some persons, in different parts of this colony, are disaffected to his Majesty's government, and by their weight and credit with the people are endeavouring to bring the country into such a situation as to afford them the fairest prospect of effecting a change in the form of it, covering their wicked designs under the specious appearance of defending their liberties, and have taken advantage of the unhappy ferment, which themselves have raised in the minds of their fellow subjects, in prosecution of their dangerous designs, to oppose the most undoubted prerogative of the King, which in a late instance I thought it expedient to exert, by removing on board his Majesty's ship the Powey a small quantity of gunpowder, belonging to his Majesty, from the magazine in this city: I have thought fit, by advice of his Majesty's Council, to issue this my proclamation, with a view of undeceiving the deluded, and of exposing to the unwary the destruction into which they may be precipitated, if they suffer themselves to be longer guided by such infatuated counsels.

Although I consider myself, under the authority of the crown, the only constitutional judge in what manner the munition, provided for the protection of the people of this government, it is to be disposed of for that end, yet, for effecting the salutary objects of this proclamation, and removing from the minds of his Majesty's subjects the groundless suspicions they have imbibed, I think proper to declare, that the apprehensions which seemed to prevail throughout this wholecountry, of an intended insurrection of the slaves , who had been seen in large numbers, in the night-time, about the magazine, and my knowledge of its being a very insecure depository, were my inducements to that measure; and I chose the night as the properest season, because I knew the temper of the times, and the misinterpretations of my design, which would be apt to prevail, if the thing should be known. Acting under these motives, I certainly rather deserved the thanks of the country than their reproaches. But, whenever the present ferment shall subside, and it shall become necessary to put arms into the hands of the militia, for the defence of the people, against a foreign enemy, or intestine insurgents, I shall be as ready, as on a late occasion, to exert my best abilities in the service of the country. In the meantime, as it is indispensably necessary to maintain order, and the authority of the laws, and thereby the dignity of his Majesty's government, I exhort and require, in his Majesty's name, all his faithful subjects, to leave expedient unessayed which may tend to that happy end. Such as are not to be influenced by the love of order, for its own sake, and the blessings it is always productive, of, would do well to consider the internal weakness of this colony, as well as the dangers to which it is exposed from a savage enemy; who, from the most recent advices I have received from the frontier inhabitants, are ready to renew their hostilities against the people of this country. But as, on the one hand, nothing can justify men, without proper authority, in a rapid recurrence to arms, nothing excuse resistance to the executive power in the due enforcement of law, so, on the other, nothing but such resistance, an outrageous proceedings, shall ever compel me to avail myself of any means that may carry the appearance of severity.

Anxious to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country, and to induce a firmer reliance on the goodness and tenderness of our most gracious sovereign, to all his subjects equally, and on the wisdom of his councils or a redress of their real grievances, which can only be obtained by loyal and constitutional applications, I again call upon and require all his majesty's liege subjects, and especially all Magistrates and other officers, both civil and military, to exert themselves in removing the discontents, and suppressing the spirit of faction, which prevail among the people; that a dutiful submission to the laws of the land may be strictly observed, which shall ever be the rule of my conduct, as the interest and happiness of this dominion ever have been, and shall continue to be, the objects of my administration.

WHEREAS there is too much reason to suppose that some persons, in the different parts of this colony, are disaffected to his Majesty's government, and by their weight and credit with the people are endeavouring to bring the country into such a situation as to afford them the fairest prospect of effecting a change in the form of it, covering their wicked designs under the specious appearance of defending their liberties, and have taken advantage of the unhappy ferment, which themselves have raised in the minds of their fellow subjects, in prosecution of their dangerous designs to oppose the most undoubted prerogative of the King, which in a late instance I thought it expedient to exert by removing on board his Majesty's hip the Fowey, a small quantity of gunpowder, belonging to his Majesty, from the magazine in this city; I have thought fit, by advice of his Majesty's council, to issue this my proclamation, with a view of undeceiving the deluded, and of exposing to the unwary the destruction into which they may be precipitated, if they suffer themselves to be longer guided by such infatuated counsels.
Although I consider myself, under the authority of the crown, the only constitutional judge, in what manner the munitions, provided for the protection of the people of this government, is to be disposed of for that end; yet for effecting the salutary objects of this proclamation, and removing from the minds of his Majesty's subjects the groundless suspicions they have imbibed, I think proper to declare that the apprehensions which seemed to prevail throughout this whole country of an intended insurrection of the slaves , who had been seen in large numbers, in the night time, about the magazine, and my knowledge of its being a very insecure depositary, were my inducements to that measure, and I chose the night as the properest season, because I knew the temper of the times, and the misinterpretations of my design which would be apt to prevail if the thing should be known. Acting under these motives, I certainly rather deserved the thanks of the country than their reproaches. But, whenever the present ferment shall subside, and it shall become necessary to put arms into the hands of the militia, for the defence of the people against a foreign enemy or intestine insurgents, I shall be as ready as on a late occasion to exert my best abilities in the service of the country. In the mean time, as it is indispensably necessary to maintain order and the authority of the laws, and thereby the dignity of his Majesty's government, I exhort and require, in his Majesty's name, all his faithful subjects, to leave no expedient unessayed which may tend to that happy end. Such as are not to be influenced by the love of order for its own sake, and the blessings it is always productive of, would do well to consider the internal weakness of this colony, as well as the dangers to which it is exposed from a savage enemy; who, from the most recent advices I have received from the frontier inhabitants, are ready to renew their hostilities against the people of this country. But, as on the one hand, nothing can justify men, without proper authority, in a rapid recurrence to arms, nothing excuse resistance to the executive power in the due enforcement of law, so on the other, nothing but such resistance and outrageous proceedings shall ever compel me to avail myself of any means that may carry the appearance of severity.

Anxious to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country, and to induce a firmer reliance on the goodness and tenderness of our most gracious Sovereign to all his subjects equally, and on the wisdom of his councils for a redress of all their real grievances, which can only be obtained by loyal and constitutional applications, I again call upon the require all his Majesty's liege subjects, and especially all magistrates and other officers, both civil and military, to exert themselves in removing the discontents, and suppressing the spirit of faction, which prevail among the people, that a dutiful submission to the laws of the land may be strictly observed, which shall ever be the rule of my conduct, as the interest and happiness of this dominion ever have been, and shall continue to be, the objects of my administration.

GIVEN under my hand, and the seal of the colony, at Williamsburg,
this 3d day of May , 1775, and in the 15th year of his
Majesty's reign .

The Virginia Gazette,3,Alexander Purdie,"Williamsburg, Virginia",1775_06_16,"June 16, 1775",1775,editorial ,"Williamsburg, Virginia",male,"FROM the disposition which the enemies of this country have already shewn, there is but too much reason to suspect that the late proceedings in this colony will be represented in England in a light the most unfavourable to the people; and perhaps some actions may have been committed, which, to those who view them from a distance, and have not felt the provocations which led to them, may appear violent and unjustifiable. To enable mankind, therefore, to form a proper judgment of what has passed, a plain narrative of facts seems necessary, a narrative published upon the spot, where any falsehood may be contradicted, any errour or partiality corrected, and every measure supported by its true motives. Something of this kind has appeared to every one necessary, it has been looked for, but the general expectation has been disappointed; and it is to be feared, that our friends in other countries will interpret out silence into an inability to justify our conduct, whilst our enemies will triumph, in the supposition that we have at length quitted the paths of wisdom and of virtue. Such considerations as these have induced me to attempt what I wished to see from some abler hand; and probably my weak endeavours may be the means of rousing others, who are more capable, of doing justice to the subject.

The rise and progress of the present troubles in America are so well known, through most pasts of the world, and our resistance to arbitrary power so generally applauded, that I may well be excused from looking far backwards, and from vindicating the first steps of American opposition. Though Virginia most heartily concurred, and in many instance took the lead, in the virtuous struggles of the colonies, yet, till lately, she was free from those direful effects of ministerial tyranny which some other parts of the continent experienced. The first thing which particularly disturbed her tranquillity was a threatened insurrection of her negro slaves , in the beginning of the spring 1775. Whether this was general, or who were the instigators, remains as yet a secret. There was reason, however, to believe that most of the negroes were too well affected to their masters, and too apprehensive of the bad consequences, as well as suspicious of the friendship of our adversaries, to join in such a wicked scheme. From some hints, it was inferred that the negroes had not been without encouragement from a Gentleman of the Navy, who has distinguished himself lately in our rivers. Whatever the plot was, it was seasonably discovered, and effectual measures taken to suppress it. To the Northward, the storm seemed to thicken; every ship from England brought intelligence of some fresh instance of ministerial vengeance denounced against us; our hopes of peace and redress from that quarter declined daily; and we saw nothing before us but abject slavery , or the horrours of a civil war. We viewed the alternative with sorrow, but hesitated not a moment which to prefer. The Convention of March 1775 directed that the colony should be put into the best posture of defence, and that, whilst every step was taken to procure an honourable reconciliation, nothing should be omitted which could enable us, by the sword, to defend our just rights and privileges. In the third week of April, the country was again alarmed, by the Governour's removing in the night from the colony magazine, and putting on board his Majesty's schooner the Magdalen, Capt. Collins, fifteen barrels of gunpowder, nearly the whole which the magazine at that time contained; and it was also discovered, that he had spoiled several of the fire-arms of their locks. Upon the first intelligence of this action, many of the inhabitants of Williamsburg flew to their arms, and resolved in that way to demand reparation. No violence, however, was committed; they were persuaded to disperse, and the common hall addressed his Excellency. Their address set forth, that the magazine was erected at the publick expense of the colony, and appropriated to the safe-keeping of such munition as should be lodged there, for the protection and security of the country, to be used by the militia in case of invasions or insurrections , and that it was, therefore, the only proper repository to be resorted to in times of imminent danger; that, from various reports of internal insurrections , that utmost attention to their security was become necessary; and they therefore desired to know his motive for carrying off the powder in such a manner, and entreated him immediately to return it to the magazine. To this his Excellency replied, that the report of an insurrection in a neighbouring county had induced him to remove the powder from the magazine, where he did not think it safe, to a place of perfect security; that he would return it, when it was wanted on any insurrection ; that he had removed it in the night, to prevent any alarm; that he was surprised to hear the people were under arms on this occasion, and that should not think it prudent to put powder into their hands in such a situation. This answer gave no satisfaction: The people could not conceive how disarming them would discourage their negroes from rising, should they be so disposed; nor could they divine how he could procure the powder, upon any emergency, from a vessel whose station for one hour war uncertain. The magazine had never yet been attempted by the negroes; and, had this been apprehended, they thought it might easily have been secured by a guard. Upon the whole, they looked upon the Governour's answer as evasive and insulting; and the people were, with difficulty, kept within the bounds of moderation.","likely authored by Alexander Purdie, the contemporary owner of the gazette; references the threatened insurrections of slaves in Virginia"

My Lord ,

WE his Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Burgesses of Virginia, beg leave to inform your Lordship, that the publick magazine is now repaired, and in fit condition for the reception of arms and ammunition.

We therefore request your Lordship will be pleased to order the powder, lately removed from thence, to be returned, agreeable to your Lordship's promise, continued in your written message to this House. We farther beg leave to inform you Lordship, that it appears to the House, form the report of their committee appointed to inspect the publick magazine, that there are no arms therein sit for service. At this critical time, my Lord, when your Excellency assures us of the great probability of an Indian invasion, at a time too when an insurrection of our slaves may be encouraged, merely from a notoriety of a total deficiency in our publick stores of arms and ammunition, it is a duty we owe to our country and ourselves to remind your Lordship, that the legislature of this colony have long since made ample provision for the purchase of arms and ammunition, and established a competent fund for that purpose, by granting to his Majesty one shilling and three pence sterling upon the tunnage of all vessels trading to this country. This fund, my Lord, had, for several years last past, exceeded three thousand pounds sterling per annum; and our predecessors, in former Assemblies, trusting that government would always make a necessary and adequate provision in a matter so essential to the immediate and future preservation of this colony, have not interfered in this business. But, my Lord, this House, finding a total inattention in government to his important provision, although it must have appeared essential more than twelve months ago, and still observing that no means are pursued to supply a deficiency so alarming, now conceive it to be their duty, not only to represent this grievance to your Lordship, but also to request that you will be pleased to order that two thousand stand of arms, five tuns of powder, and twenty tuns of lead, at least, with a sufficient quantity of other military stores, be immediately provided for the defence of this colony, in case of any invasion or insurrection , and that the same be lodged in the publick magazine. In case the fund afore-mentioned shall prove deficient, this House assure your Lordship, that they will make such farther or other provision as may be necessary to enable your Lordship to comply with this request.","House of Burgesses address, mentions Indian invasion and a time when an insurrection of slaves could be encouraged"

The Virginia Gazette,3,Alexander Purdie,"Williamsburg, Virginia",1775_08_04,"August 4, 1775",1775,editorial ,Virginia,unknown,"Mr . PURDIE,

THERE are few attempts in life so unlikely to give universal satisfaction as those that are brought before the all scrutinising eye of the publick; for although a man be so fortunate as to please some, he may, on the other hand, offend many: And there are some men, possessed of a tolerable knowledge of men and manners, but what must be, on the least attentive consideration, assured of the truth of this thesis. How careful then ought that man to be, who makes his appearance in the publick papers, in knowing that he is embarked, if not in an unoffending, yet a righteous cause! Thus equipped, he may fearless pass the rock of criticism, if not with eclat, with that, at least, which affords more permanent felicity, the heartfelt commendation of a good conscience. These animadversions lead me to a few strictures on our truly great and worthy governour's proclamation, published in mess. Dixon and Hunter's paper of the 13th of this instant. I confess, in the first place, that it is with the most pungent sorrow I find that justice, and the great cause of America's inherent rights, make it indispensably necessary, in those unhappy days, that nothing should pass unnoticed that is not dignified by the sacred signature of truth, and which, through the malversation of bad and designing men, might have the baneful tendency of extending the unnatural breach between Great Britain and her colonies, and bring on the additional displeasure of our gracious king . Of such a tendency appears our governour's proclamation of the above date, particularly aimed at PATRICK HENRY, Jun. esq; his country's, and America's, unalterable and unappalled great advocate and friend. As most of the good people of this country may have seen this unparalleled proclamation, I shall not take up much of their or your time, mr. Purdie, in a very recital of it; suffice to say, that the whole must appear a mere ministerial trick, calculated to please some, to delude others, and, what is of more serious and alarming consequence (similar to one of his other laudable efforts *) to prejudice and detract from the great American cause, by effecting a disunion amongst the friends of it, as the only possible means of obtaining success to ministerial machinations. The degenerate tools of lawless power may applaud his lordship's ingenuity, but the honest, virtuous, and upright sons of constitutional liberty, will reprobate the want of that candour and nobleness of spirit which alone can give effulgence to high birth or exalted station, and deprived of which, either the one, or the other, must, in the reflection of the virtuous mind (to use the great mr. Pope's word) appear but as so much ""Leather or prunella."" There are, however, representations of the conduct of the said mr. HENRY, and his deluded followers (as his lordship is pleased, fashionably, to call them) so exceedingly inconsonant to my idea of the case, that his lordship must pardon me if I should, for the sake of justice, attempt to set the matter in a different and less partial point of view. He lordship observes, ""that the said mr. Henry, with a number of deluded followers, had taken up arms, chosen their officers, and, stiling themselves an independent company, had marched out of their county, encamped, and put themselves into a posture of war; and had written letters &c. to the great terrour of all his majesty's faithful subjects, and in open defiance of law and government; and have committed other acts of violence, particularly in extorting from his majesty's receiver general the sum of 3301. under pretence of replacing the powder he (the governour) thought proper to order from the magazine; whence, adds his lordship, it undeniably appears that there is no longer the least security for the life or property of any man."" Would not strangers to this manoeuvre of mr. HENRY 's be induced readily to believe, from this proclamation of his lordship, that his conduct in the affair of the powder was directly consistent with the greatest rectitude; and, on the contrary, that mr. HENRY 's behaviour was, in the extreme, impolitical, disorderly, and base? But let such first recur to the many poor subterfuges that ministerial vicegerents have lately been drove to, and then they will not be greatly astonished at the contents of his lordship's proclamation.

The powder which was removed from the magazine in the city of Williamsburg, under covert of the night (a time most friendly and best adapted to dark and insidious designs) appears clearly to have been, if not the permanent and exclusive property of this colony, at least so intended for its direct emolument and protection, by an act of Assembly passed in the first year of king George the 1st's reign, entitled An act for erecting a magazine ;"" that his lordship's removal of it on board one of his majesty's armed vessels, just at that alarming and critical time, was, in my view, illegal, and a competent declaration of his hostile and inimical designs against this unhappy country; and sufficient, of itself, to have roused the good people of it from that lethargick state of security into which the great appearance of his lordship's friendship had lulled them; and farther, to have placed themselves in such a posture of defence as might enable them to guard against the impending blow which this step of his lordship plainly told them was but too fast approaching. The inhabitants of Williamsburg, justly alarmed and incensed at such behaviour from his lordship, like men, determined to support their constitutional rights and property, in opposition to every act of violence under Heaven against them, take up arms, and are about to demand restitution of the powder, when they are dissuaded from such a step, by gentlemen in whom great confidence is placed, who persuade them to lay down their arms, and return to their respective homes; assuring them, at the same time, that every packsack endeavour should be made in order to have the powder replaced in the magazine. They then convened a common-hall, and in a very respectful manner address his lordship on the impropriety of his conduct in the affair of the powder, entreating him, at the same time, to return it again to the magazine, and thereby restore peace and order to the inhabitants of the town; to which said address his lordship was pleased to return a verbal answer (being, it is said, peculiarly happy in expressing his sentiments with ease and propriety that way) whereby it most evidently appears, that his lordship expressly avows the impropriety of his conduct in the removal of the powder, in promising, upon his "" word and honour ,"" that in case there should be an insurrection of the slaves , which he acknowledges there was cause to apprehend, he would then return the powder, on being allowed an half hour to do it in. The inconsistency of such an answer is so plain, that it needs no comment. In short, several gentlemen, who were dissatisfied with such an evasive, contradictory, and affrontive answer, wait on his lordship in person, and entreat him, as the representative of his majesty here, as the chief magistrate, and, above all, as a friend to peace and order, to return the powder, and thereby quiet the fears and apprehensions of the people; which he now positively refuses to do, assigning, as a reason for his strange and unwarrantable conduct, that the people of Williamsburg had been in arms. But attend to his subsequent conduct, and see if it accords with those pompons professions of regard for peace, order, and good government, and the happiness of the people (who are so unhappy as to be under his rule) which he would induce a belief are the grand objects of his care and study. Conscious that the people would no longer acquiesce in a behaviour in one moment so disingenuous and evasive, in another so disrespectful and irritating, he determined to sting off the mask, and bid defiance to their utmost efforts to regain the powder; and therefore immediately began to arm his menial servants, who were, by their lord and master's example, taught to look upon and treat the good people of this country with the greatest indignity and contempt. Add to all this, that we had just heard that many of our worthy and noble friends, the guardians and zealous supporters of our liberty, were on the black list of American victims, destined to sacrifice, in order to appease those sanguinary wretches in power; and that farther, we had received the long feared and melancholy news, that the sword was now drawn by the king's troops against our brethren the Bostonians, who were then bleeding in the common cause. Thus unhappily circumstanced on all sides, what does mr. Henry to deserve those in glorious epithets, which are, though obscurely, yet most certainly aimed principally at him, not only by his lordship's candid and liberal address to the Council, previous to the issuing of a former proclamation, but by those also in exalted station . Who it was hoped, from their affinity to our wrongs, and having received their birth there, would have entertained sentiments of a more generous and liberal kind of those who are the produce of the same country, and in loyalty and attachment to their gracious sovereign, not an iota, I trust, inferiour to them. I repeat, what does mr. HENRY (matters being thus situated) to deserve the censure of his countymen. Why, like the vigilant guardian and protector of their constitutional rights and liberties, he was resolved, with proper assistance, by the force of arms to effect a resistance, of the powder (or an equivalent thereto) which had been by low fraud and artifice removed out of the country's possession, and which he now was sorry to find pacifick measures were not likely to accomplish. This gentlemen, therefore, by the advice and determination of the Hanover committee, held at New-Castle the 2d instant, accompanied by many of his respectable and worthy countrymen, set out from Newcastle on their way to the Capitol, and were joined on their way down by several spirited gentlemen from different counties. With what prudence and penetration mr. Henry took his measures, and what they eventually produced, may be fully known by a reference to a publication of his conduct, at large, in moss. Dixon and Hunter's paper of the 13th instant; and as the matter stands represented there, and which is incontrovertibly consistent with the real truth of the case, how then does his lordship get his intelligence that this movement of mr. HENRY'S was to the great ""terrour of all his majesty's faithful subjects."" From whence does he learn that mr. HENRY had committed ""acts of violence."" Have any of those terrified ""faithful subjects,"" on whom those acts of violence were committed, preserved their complaint before his lordship, in order to obtain redress? Or are these words inserted only to heighten or aggravate this supposed guilty conduct of mr. HENRY'S, in the opinion of those who cannot be, in all probability, from the remoteness of their situation, furnished with an impartial and fair state of the case? The guilty, perhaps, might fear and tremble at an apprehension of the just vengeance of the incensed people, roused and provoked as they were by reiterated acts of oppression and tyranny; but whether the innocent Americans (of which I thank Heaven there is by far the greater majority) were terrified and frightened by this attempt, of mr. HENRY'S to regain their property, I leave the candid part of mankind to determine, from the publication of the proceedings of the many committees which have sat on this occasion, as may be seen in the papers subsequent to this step taken by mr. HENRY. Thus much, mr. Purdie, I have thought proper to lay before the publick, in vindication of the conduct of a gentleman, who is now absent, and, as the advocate and steady friend of his country, contending, I doubt not, for all that is precious and worth the preserving, to those who are by nature free, and who, by their laws and constitution, have an indubitable right to regain so, in opposition to every power to earth to make them otherwise.

Had his lordship, at this perplexed and unhappy conjuncture of affairs, steadily pursued that noble line of right which prudence and his duty had marked out to him, had he evinced from his actions, in accordance to his professions, that the happiness of the people which he ruled, was his great object and care; had he, like a good, virtuous, and great man, stepped in as a mediator in this unnatural struggle between Great Britain and her colonies, and attempted to close, rather than, by dissingenuous misrepresentations, to widen the breach; I trust he would still have continued to receive that grateful tribute of applause which the people here have, on some late occasions, so cordally offered up to him: But, from his late conduct, as held up to the world, what confidence can they place in him who has declared himself to be (and his actions manifest he is not in jest) their opposed and dangerous enemy?",again an editorial on the powder magazine removed from williamsburg and the potential enslaved insurrections possibly encouraged by Dunmore

The following is a copy of the address of the Hon. House of Burgesses, at the last session of Assembly, which was transmitted to the Governor whilst he resided on board the FOWEY man of war, in answer to his Excellency's message inserted in this gazette of the 17th of JUNE

MY LORD,

THE House of Burgesses received your Lordship's written message of the 10th instant, in answer to the joint address of his Majesty's Honorable Council and this House, with equal concern and amazement. We were totally unprepared for so severe and cruel a return to the respectful application made to your Lordship, solely ducted by our duty to his Majesty, and the most earnest desire of contributing every thing in our power towards promoting, as well your Lordship's own happiness, as that of your Lady and whole family. This step, we hoped, would have proved the happy means of restoring that tranquility and harmony, you were pleased to flatter us with your earnest wishes to have established. Who were the peculiar objects of your tenderness, that you so kindly in favour to them, declined a particular enumeration, we know not, but are sorry that your Lordship had so little feeling for the honor, and integrity, of this House. Your have now, my Lord, driven us to the disagreeable necessity of inquiring minutely into the causes of the late disturbances in this country. It is not with the most distant inclination to give your Lordship the slightest umbrage that we engage in so irksome a task, but purely to do justice to our much injured country, that we recur to different, ands some distant, transactions. The charges of disloyalty and disaffection in our countrymen to our most gracious Sovereign, and his government, as insinuated in your Lordship's message, and some other public acts, are as grievous as they are unmerited. Words, we know, are too often but empty sounds. We appeal not to our processions, however sincere, but to facts, of public notoriety. The loyalty of this his Majesty most ancient colony stands concussed, as recorder by many of your worthy predecessors. We will presume to carry your attention no further back that to the administration of a Governor immediately preceding your Lordship. Previous to his coming over to Virginia, there has arisen some unhappy disputes between Great Britain and the colonies. His Majesty was graciously pleased to send over to us, from his immediate presence, the truly noble Lord BZOTETOURT, who told us, that he had received it in command from his Majesty to do justice, and maintain the rights of all his subjects. He cheerfully entered upon the duties of his exalted satin, in which he acted as a true representative of his royal master, at once supporting the dignity of his crown, dispensing the utmost justice, and diffusing benevolence throughout the country. By his exemplary conduct, in all respects, he accomplished what he deemed a glorious work; He gave us tranquillity, and happiness. Indeed he was often heard to declared, that the business of a Governor of Virginia was much easier than he could have conceived, as he found that the government almost executed itself. Matters were not yet that time carried on, and precipitated, with so high an hand, on the other side of the water, as at present. This probably was owing to his minutely examining every subject to the bottom himself, taking nothing upon trust; to his discountenancing tale-bearers, and malicious informers; and, at last, making a faithful representation of things, as he found them. In a short, too short a time, for the happiness of Virginia, it pleased God to remove him from us. When we received the account of your Lordship's appointment, we indulged the pleasing hopes that we should again be made happy in a ruler; and, when you were pleased to honour us with your presence, we vied with each other in endeavouring to make your administration easy and agreeable. Upon the report that your Lady and family were coming over to you, every one, we believe, who heard it, was eager in expectation of an event which was likely to give addition to your happiness. We received her Ladyship, and your children, with every expression of heart-felt joy, and have considered our countrymen as exceedingly happy in having such respectable pledges amongst them. Changes, my Lord, seldom happen without some sufficient cause. If, therefore, you have, or think you have, discovered any alteration in the sentiments or behaviour of those you preside over, it may be worth vour while, as well as ours, to search out the reason of it. Respect, my Lord, is not to be obtained by force, from a free people. If genuine, it must be a perfect volunteer; and nothing is so likely to ensure it to one in your station as dignity of character, a candid and exemplary conduct. We decline, on this occasion, a discussion of the subject unhappily in dispute between Great Britain and the colonies. We presume not to interfere with your authority in summoning or dissolving Assemblies, when, by advice of your Council, you think there is proper occasion. What we claim, as an act of justice, is, that our conduct should be fairly and impartially represented to our Sovereign. We do not mean to insinuate that your Lordship would, designedly, misrepresent facts; but it is much to be feared that you too easily give credit to some designing persons, who, to the great injury of this community, possess much too large a share of your confidence. We have seen, my Lord, the copy of a letter you were pleased to write to the Earl of Dartmouth, dated the 29th of May 1774. The design of then Assembly was entirely misconceived, and the ill impressions your Lordship's letter may have made on the minds of his Majesty, and his Ministers, prove how dangerous it is, and how very unjust it may be, to attempt penetrating the thoughts of others, when they are not certainly known. Suspicions, we humbly conceive, can never justify direct and positive accusations. Men, we know, differ in religious sentiments dome may believe in the superintendence of a providence, and that the care, especially of nations, is an object of Divine Goodness; whilst others may think, or affect to treat this, as well as other matters, which our religion teaches, as thing merely chimerical. We have likewise seen an authentic copy of extracts of another of your Lordship's Letters to the same noble Earl, dated the 24th of December 1774. The more injurious the unfavorable representations, contained in this letter, were likely to be to this country, the more careful we should have hoped your Lordship would have been in examining the evidences of the facts stated. Your Lordship had been pleased to represent, in the first letter, our House of Burgesses as fond of having it thought that a determined resolution to deny and oppose the authority of Parliament always originates with them. Whether this was intended to draw down the particular resentment of Parliament of this country, your Lordship can best determine. They have, indeed, protested against the power of Paliament, when they though it extended contrary to the principles of the constitution; but we do not know that they every affected to take the lead of the other colonies, in this, or any other measure. The times of entering their protestations were merely accidental, as circumstances happened; and it is notorious, that the subject of the present complaint had been under the consideration of some other colonies, before the Virginias took it up It would seem, form your Lordship's letter of the 24th of December, that the association adopted by the General Congress was first recommended from Virginia; whereas the truth is, that, in Virginia, nothing more was resolved against, at first, than the importation and use of East India commodities. The general non-export and non-import agreement came first recommended to us from several of the northern colonies. This, we own, makes no difference now, as the several colonies have united in the association. It is only remarked, since this circumstance seems to have been thought material, as no strong testimony of a kind disposition in your Lordship towards this country. That committees were chosen, in the several counties, is admitted. The design of them was to observe the conduct of those who were inimical to the interest of the country. They were required to publish the names of all transgressors, that the country might know their friends from their foes. This you were pleased to term ""inviting the vengeance of a lawless mob to be exercised upon the unhappy victims."" You further represented these committees as assuming an authority to inspect the books, invoices, and all the secrets of the trade and correspondence of merchants. This, my Lord, was high colouring of assumed facts; which we, who inhabit different parts of the country, are strangers to. To close your narrative upon this head, you were pleased to inform your noble correspondent, that every ""county in this colony was arming a company of ""men, whom they call an independent company, for the avowed ""purpose of protecting their committees, and to be employed ""against Government, if occasion require; and that the committee ""of one county had proceeded so far as to swear the men of ""their independent company to execute all orders which should ""be given them from their committee."" These, my Lord, are things entirely without our knowledge; and upon the strictest inquire, we are convinced they deserve no credit. There were a few companies of Gentlemen formed who were desirous of perfecting themselves in military exercise; but we find not more than six or seven throughout the whole colony, which consists of sixty one counties. This was designed to distinguish them from the militia at large; the first, and most considerable of these, was instituted for the better protection of the inhabitants of Norfolk borough, and afterwards received your Lordship's approbation, so far, that you expressed the warmest wishes that the example might be followed throughout the country, and gave commissions to their officers. That these companies were connected with the committees, or that they were ever designed to act against, or in any sort to interfere with, what you are pleased to call government, we do not, know, or believe, but, on the contrary, we are verily persuaded that they were always ready and willing to exert themselves to support the laws, and his Majesty's government, to the utmost of their power. Your Lordship's assertion, that the ""power of government was entirely disregarded, if not wholly ""overturned, and that there was not a justice of the peace in ""Virginia who acted except as a committee man,"" we cannot but consider as highly unjust, and extremely injurious to us. We have the greatest reason to believe, having it in full proof, that the magistrates throughout the colony duly attended their respective courts; and though, for the reasons assigned in our former address to your Lordship, they could not think themselves legally authorised to hear and determine civil suits, yet we are persuaded that their former endeavours to preserve the peace and good order of government were not interrupted, but exerted in the usual manner. The original cause of suspending the trials of civil disputes was, as your Lordship observes, the want of a see bill. This legal defect was, as your much lamented, and not used, that we know of, as a popular argument, by any man of good sense; nor did the inhabitants of this country join, in what your are pleased to call an opprobrious measure, to engage their"" English ""creditors to join the clam ours of this country. Your Lordship's assertion, that ""not a few did it to avoid paying their ""debts, in which many of the principal people here are much involved,"" we can only answer for ourselves in the negative; and must consider so indiscriminate a charge as extremely injurious. We were so far from desiring to do injustice to creditors, that it gave us great pain to observe that such a step was thought necessary; and nothing but the hopes of being relieved from the arbitrary system of colony government, attempted to be introduced, could have prevailed with us to submit to a stoppage of our exports. The merchants of London, in their written message, by a respectable member of their body, to the committee of the House of Commons, have done us ample justice in this respect; by representing, that they should have no uneasiness about remittances from America, unless Parliament pursued such means as were likely to prevent them. The Congress, my Lord, we consider as instituted on principles of public necessity; we do not deny our having a proper respect for that body; we learn, from good authority, that their humble and dutiful petition to his Majesty was graciously received, though, it is with concern, we are told it has hitherto produced no good effect: But that the inhabitants of Virginia treated with marks of reverence the laws of the Congress, ""which they never bestowed on their legal government, or ""the laws proceeding from it, is one of a great number of facts requiring proof; since we must take leave to say, with confidence, that his Majesty's subjects of Virginia have been second to none others, even to his dutiful and loyal subjects in any part of his wide-extended dominions, in all due respect to his government, Governors, and all in authority under him.

We cannot but remind your Lordship of the General Congress held in America, with the royal approbation, in the last war. The united interest indeed of Great Britain, and the colonies, might have then demanded it. In imitation of so laudable an example, America resolved on a like measure, as equally, if not more necessary, at this critical juncture. Your Lordship's account of the effects the association is likely to produce, considering it as a matter of opinion, we are little concerned to interfere with. Time only can discover the consequences of it; but your heavy charge against those called people of fortune, ""that they supply themselves and Negroes for two or three years, to the distresses of the middling and poorer sort,"" must have proceeded from your giving too easy credit to ill-founded reports. Some, but very few, may have supplied themselves, as opportunity offered, for the present year. This, we believe, is the most that has been done; and we are persuaded of a material mistake in another respect, it is being the general opinion, founded on good grounds, that the middling and poorer sort will fare much better than those of fortune, who have large numbers of slaves to provide for. Engaged on this topick, we cannot refrain from observing how strangely our views have been misrepresented. By the association, we intend nothing that is illegal; we are only resolved to be content with our home-spun manufacturers, however mean in quality, unless things can be restored to their former channel, the only security we desire for what we know our excellent constitution entitles us to. What your Lordship is pleased to represent as the arbitrary proceedings of the committees, we trust will produce none of those very dreadful effects you have painted in such alarming colours. The whole colony, very few excepted, is united: and, from such union of sentiments, expectations must be exceedingly sanguine, indeed, in supposing that discord will arise.

How the proceedings of the General Convention, in the month of March last, may have been represented, we know not; but, from the foregoing specimens, it is to be presumed in no very favourable light. These meetings, my Lord, unless it can be supposed that a whole country could entirely lose sight of its security and most essential interests, were rendered absolutely necessary, first by the dissolution, and afterwards by repeated prorogations, of the General Assembly. Upon inquiry into the state of the colony, it was found that there had been almost a total inattention to the proper training and disciplining of our militia. Various subsequent acts of our legislature, amendatory of the law of 1738, had expired; the act providing against invasions and insurrections was near expiring, and it was uncertain whether an opportunity would be given the General Assembly to revive it. Taking a further view of our situation, it was found that our inhabitants were exposed to the incursions of a barbarous and savage enemy. From the best accounts received from Great Britain, there was too much reason to be convinced that his Majesty's Ministry were prosecuting the most rigorous and arbitrary measures towards subjugating the whole continent of America to their despotic rule; which measures, it was more than probable, had been suggested from hence, and the other colonies: That a scheme, the most diabolical, had been meditated, and generally recommended, by a person of great influence, to offer freedom to our slaves , and turn them against their masters. The Convention, to guard against these dangers, not clearly seen into before that time, recommended a strict attention to the militia law of 1738; but, thinking this defective in many essential points, considering that, under this law, the whole militia were not obliged to exercise so frequently as might be necessary, it was recommended that volunteer companies should be formed in each county, for the better defence and protection of the whole country. These proceedings, according to an usual style, it is more than probable, have been represented as designed to oppose government; whereas, we are persuaded, that nothing was farther from the intentions of the Convention. A review of their resolutions must convince every unprejudiced mind that the utmost respect was paid to his Majesty and his legal government, and that the Convention had much pleasure in expressing their obligations to your Lordship for your late services. The truth is, my Lord, that his Majesty's dutiful subjects in this colony have the utmost attachment to their sovereign; they admire, they love the constitution, and will risk every thing most dear and valuable in support of it. These are principles imbibed in their infancy, and their constant care is to inculcate them inculcate them upon the minds of their children; they meditate or design nothing in the least offensive: But, if it is expected that they should sit down supinely, and submit to yokes which neither they nor their forefathers were able to bear, they must acknowledge that they have the sensibility and feelings of freemen, actuating them to a proper and justifiable defence of those rights which are guarantied by the laws and principle of the constitution.

We have, my Lord, made the strictest and minutest inquiry into the causes of the late disturbances. We find, firms the examination of many respectable merchants natives of Great Britain, residing in different part of this colony, and from other Gentlemen of character, that the country was in perfect state of tranquility till they received an account of your Lordship's removal of the gunpowder from the public magazine, to one of his Majesty's ships of war, and of your irritating and most unjustifiable threats.

The inhabitants of this country, my Lord, could not be strangers to the many attempts in the northern colonies to disarm the people, and thereby deprive them of the only means of defending their lives and property. We know, from good authority, that the like measures were generally recommended by the ministry, and that the export of power from Great Britain had been prohibited. Judge then how very alarming a removal of the small stock which remained in the public magazine, for the defence of the country, and the stripping the guns of their locks, must have been to any people, who had the smallest regard for their security. The manner, and time, of doing it, made no small addition to the general apprehension of your Lordship's views. The reason assigned by your Lordship for taking his step, we should have thought the most likely, at any other time, to have directed a very different conduct. We should have supposed, that a well-grounded apprehension of an insurrection of the slaves ought to have called forth the utmost exertions to suppress it. The world will probably judge your Lordship's method of doing this, the least likely to effect the necessary purpose. Your Lordship having represented this powder as the King's peculiar property, supposing it to have been brought from one of his ships, we have made inquiry into that matter, and cannot find that there ever was any powder brought either from the Rippon or any other man of war; so that we presume your Lordship must have been misinformed as to this fact, since the powder was removed, as it was not relied on in your answer to the address of the corporation of the city of Williamsburg. Be this, however, as it may, we conceive the case would not be materially altered. We must remind your Lordship, that, by a very ancient law of this country, enacted so long since as the thirty second year of the reign of his Majesty King Charles the second, for raising a public revenue; and for the better support of this government, amongst other provisions, an impost of one half pound of new gunpowder, and three pounds of leaden shot, or one shilling and three pence sterling, was imposed on all ships or vessels coming into this colony. In the ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne, the impost of one shilling and three pence on the tonnage of vessels was continued, for port duties. It is evident, my Lord, that the original and chief design of this particular impost was to provide, from time to time, a proper stock of munitions for the defence of the country. We have examined the produce of this fund for thirteen years past, and find that it yielded in that time twenty eight thousand five hundred and three pounds three shillings and ninepence sterling, which, on an average, amounted to 2192 l. . sterling per annum; and it is observable, that for the four last years it yielded considerably more than three thousand pounds in each year. It may from hence be fairly submitted, whether it was not incumbent on the executive part of government to have provided, in the first place, from so large and ample a fund, a proper stock of arms and ammunition, which was so essentially necessary for the security of the country. If, my Lord, instead of applying a reasonable part of this money to such necessary purposes, the whole has been applied to other occasions of government, and powder and arms had been procured through some other channel. we should presume that these. then stored in the public magazine, built at the expense of the country, and appropriated to the safekeeping of all military stores, ought there to have remained, till the exigencies of the country demanded them.

We find, my Lord, that the inhabitants of the city of Williamsburg, in the midst of which the magazine in situated, upon discovering that the powder was removed, the time and manner of its being done, in the dead of night, under an escort of armed marines, commanded by Capt. Henry Collins of the Magdalen, were exceedingly alarmed; that many of them were so exasperated that they had recourse to arms, intending, as we understand, to compel Capt. Collins to restore the powder; but we cannot discover that the least insult was intended to your Lordship. We find that the Corporation of Williamsburg presented a very decent and respectful address to your Excellency, desiring that you would be pleased to order the powder to be returned; and, on receipt of your verbal answer, amongst the other things, avowing that it had been removed by your orders, under which Capt. Collins had acted, and promising that it should be returned in case of an insurrection , the people assembled were soon appeased, returned quietly to their respective homes, and perfect tranquility was restored in the city; that in the succeeding night, on a report that a number of armed men had landed ad a ferry about four miles from the city, the inhabitants were again much alarmed; but, upon the interposition of some Gentlemen, they were quieted, and nothing farther was done than strengthening the usual patrol for the security of the city. We farther find, that on the next day, when every thing was perfectly quiet, your Lordship sent a message into the city by one of the magistrates, which you delivered with the most solemn asseverations, that if any insult was offered to Capt. Foy, or Capt. Collins, you would declare freedom to the slaves , and lay the town in ashes; and that you could easily depopulate the whole country. What could have provoked your Lordship to this we cannot discover, as both Captain Foy and Captain Collins, and several other officers, had been frequently seen walking publicly in the streets, and no one offered either of them the least injury; nor can we discover any reason to believe that any thing of the sort was intended. The inhabitants, my Lord, could not but be exceedingly alarmed at so cruel a threat; many people considered it as part of that general plan, they had heard was recommended in England, and which was discovered by your Lordship through accident; they however, did nothing more, that we can learn, than continue their former patrols. A report of these several matters having soon circulated throughout almost the whole country, with this addition, that the most valuable guns in the magazine had been striped of their locks, and that the inhabitants of Williamsburg were in the most imminent danger, the minds of the people in general were much agitated; they assembled in different quarters, and a number of express were sent to inquire and obtain a true state of things. It appears, that, during this general uneasiness, an account was received from the northward of the engagement at Concord; the General, it seems, had sent an armed force to seize a provincial magazine. This, your Lordship may suppose, increased the apprehension of our people, as it held out to them an additional proof that the steps you had taken formed a part of that general system adopted to render the colonies defenceless. If, upon such alarm, when the minds of the people were fretted to an extreme degree, some irregularities were committed, the cause may be found in those extraordinary attempts to stretch the powers of government so much beyond their ancient and constitutional limits. It gave the greatest concern, my Lord, to all acquainted with your most amiable Lady, and her distinguished character, to hear that she had removed with her children to ore of the King's ship. We have inquired into the cause of this; and though we do not presume to prescribe to her ladyship, yet we are persuaded, that, had she known the sentiments of all ranks of people in this colony, every uneasiness would have been removed. We find, my Lord, that from the great pains taken by the magistrates, and other inhabitants of the city of Williamsburg, there could have been no real ground for fear at the time of her Ladyship's removal, unless it was produced from your Lordship's threats, which might have kept the minds of some of the citizens in suspense. A few Ladies, it appears, left the city; but it was not through apprehensive of any other danger than what your Lordship held over them. The inhabitants certainly could have entertained no suspicious of injury from their friends in the country. Who had kindly offered to come to their assistance; so that it was in the power of your Lordship, alone, to have removed her Ladyship's uneasiness.

It gives us the greatest pain, my Lord, to find, in your Excellency's message, so determined a resolution to pursue a course the most likely to revive the uneasiness of the people, and prevent that restoration of harmony for ardently wished for by all good men. You are pleased to submit to our ""judgment, whether you could reasonably have expected any good effect from communicating the ground of your uneasiness to us."" We give it as our opinion, that your Lordship had the greatest reason, if you had viewed our conduct in its proper light, to have expected the best effects from such communication, as we met your Lordship in General Assembly with the sincerest dispositions to do every thing in our power to provide for the tranquility of the country. The reasons assigned for your contrary apprehensions, we are persuaded, must have been suggested to your Lordship by some designing, malevolent informer. We can hardly suppose your Lordship could have had any well-grounded fear of personal danger, when it is notorious that you appeared publicly, as usual; and it is in proof to us, that the same night in which you left the palace, you walked alone to the Attorney General's, at the distance of upwards of a quarter of a mile, and returned unmolested; and we cannot discover that even the slightest insult was offered. If you judge of the disposition of the House of Burgesses, as to public matters, from their declining to accept an invitation to dine with your Lordship (the instance of respect and civility alluded to, and which you say you had been forward in offering to them) you have entirely mistaken their motives. A piece of civility of this sort had formerly its due weight with us; but we have little reason to suppose that such a ceremony would, at this time, be attended, on your Lordship's part, with that cordiality which we thought we had observed on former occasions. How could your Lordship think of admitting to your table a set of men, whom, together with the whole body of their constituents, you had endeavoured to paint in such despicable and odious colours? That the House of Burgesses ever countenanced the violent and disorderly proceedings of the people, we must, in justice to ourselves, take leave to deny. As to the magazine's being rifled, which you are pleased to insinuate was done with the approbation of the House, we must say, that in this also the greatest injustice is done to us. The House was sitting, closely engaged in public business, when this affair happened. Some of our members, as we believe the truth is, upon hearing what was going forward at the magazine, went up in hopes of preventing it. We are informed, that a great concourse of people, from different parts of the country, were assembled, and that many of the arms had been taken out of the magazine. Several of the members, as Private Gentlemen, remonstrated with all the people they met with against such proceedings, and prevailed with them to return what they had taken. When your Lordship was pleased to accuse the House of Burgesses of usurping the ""executive power,"" from what happened on this occasion, we presume it would have been well to have considered with what propriety they could have interfered: Had they made an order for apprehending the persons concerned, who were unknown, it would have been fruitless, and, moreover, a plain departure from the line of their authority. Such a step your Lordship might, indeed, have justly censured, as an usurpation of the executive power. or would your Lordship have recommended to the individual members to have acted as bailiffs, in seizing all offenders they met with? We never have, nor will we ever give countenance to such unjuifiable proceedings as happened that day.

Your acquaintance, my Lord, with mankind, must suggest to you the difficulty there is in restraining an incensed multitude. Many people, the irritation of whose minds had but lately subsided, we understand, had been again greatly alarmed at a late unfortunate accident, which happened to some inconsiderate young men, in their unlawful attempt, my Lord, which we condemn as highly as your Lordship can. But whether some little apology may not be suggested, from that universal anxiety which all mankind have to prepare for the defense of their lives and property, we will not determine; the point is delicate, and we leave the world to judge of it. But the means contrived, in pursuance of your Lordship's orders, by which an unfortunate culprit might probably have been hurried into eternity, without a moment's time for reflection, we conceive, can do no great honour to humanity; which, we should have supposed, would have dictated the necessity of at least giving public that spring- guns were prepared and fixed; which, it is imagined, would have answered every purpose of security too the magazine. Your Lordship's reflections on our committee, and, through them, upon this whole House, we think might have been spared, after what passed early in the session. Had the committee misbehaved, we should not have been backward in taking proper notice of it.",apprehension/knowledge of slave insurrections

WE are highly pleased with the conduct of the people of South Carolina, who have taken the troops destined for Virginia from Saint Augustine, and think ourselves the more obliged to those brave Carolinians, as those troops were to have been a reinforcement to the sixty men who have been so very formidable to the towns of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Gosport. What might have been the consequence had they arrived! But to be serious: How long will the inhabitants of those towns suffer themselves to be so shamefully insulted by l—d D—e and the captains of the men of war? To what is it owing that their committees have so unaccountably acquitted some late extraordinary delinquents? Is it to a want of zeal in the glorious cause, or of spirit to prosecute it? But we trust that the people of Norfolk will remove our doubts and jealousies, and wipe off every stain on their characters, by making a proper use of the golden opportunity Heaven has now afforded them. To do this nothing is requisite but a little spirit, with some address and ingenuity in the application of it. A number of small vessels may be easily fitted out as fire ships, and may be used with almost certainty of success, and without the least risk of lives on our part. Nor can the most loyal of his majesty's subjects condemn this measure, since it is but a proper chastisement of the most despicable tools of his greatest enemies; nor can humanity forbid it, because it is dictated by some of its first feelings, and honest indignation, and the love of our country, and is enjoined by the first law of nature.

When king, lords, and commons, have combined to enslave us; when a corrupt and abandoned parliament have voted their lives and fortunes at the service of a perfidious, cruel, and bloody administration, in the execution of their wicked plan; when, in consequence of this, fleets and armies are sent against us, which have pillaged our coasts, bombarded out towns, and but for the glorious intrepidity of our countrymen, under the particular favour and protection of the Almighty, would have spread desolation throughout our land; when we consider the damnable plot that has been laid against us of stirring up the Canadians and Indians to attack us on our frontiers, and our slaves and tories within the body of our country, whilst their fleets were to lay waste our costs; and when he have seen this plan recommended in a pamphlet written by an accursed petisioner, doctor Johnson, by the order of the minister, and under the particular patronage of the king; when we consider these things, who can hesitate a moment to declare that we ought to do all in our power to be revenged on such an administration, and to hurl down destruction on all the infernal tools? Let not our countrymen think that captain Macartney deserves more indulgence than captain Squire, on lord Dunmore: He, like captain Montague, has taken upon himself to interfere with the civil power, has impudently supposed that his presence could awe a committee, and protect a culprit, and has wickedly threatened to fire on a defenceless town. But let captain Macartney know, that whenever he lands in Virginia he is amenable to the laws of Virginia, which may punish him as a trespasser, rioter, or murderer, or as a rebel, if he should, like l—d D—e and Squire, attempt to raise an insurrection ; and we would have all those tools of government to know, that, whenever they return to England, we shall try the full force of the English laws against all such offences as they have or shall commit here. The American governors shall severely answer for their conduct in the King's Bench, and judges shall remember the fate of Epson and Dudley.","mentions the threats of canadians and ""indians"" on the frontiers and slaves from within"

extorted from the people
of Norfolk and Princess
Anne, by lord Dunmore.
WE the inhabitants of—being
fully sensible of the errors and
guilt into which this colony
hath been misled, under colour
of seeking redress of
grievances, and that a set of
factious men, stiling
themselves committees,
conventions, and congress,
have violently, and under
various pretences, usurped the
legislative and executive
powers of government, and are
thereby endeavouring to
overturn our most happy
constitution, and have incurred
the guilt of actual rebellion
against our most gracious
sovereign: We have therefore
taken an oath abjuring their
authority, and solemnly
promising, in the presence of
almighty God, to bear faith and
true allegiance to his sacred
majesty George the third; and
that we will, to the utmost of
our power and ability, support,
maintain, and defend, his
crown and dignity, against all
traitorous attempts and
conspiracies whatsoever. And
whereas armed bodies of men
are collected, in various parts
of this colony, without any
legal authority, we wish them
to be informed, that however
unwilling we should be to shed
the blond of our countrymen,
we must, in discharge of our
duty to God and the king, and
in support of the constitution
and laws of our country, oppose
their marching into this county,
where their coming can answer
no good end, but, on the
contrary, must expose us to the
ravages and horrors of a civil
war; and, for that purpose, we
are determined to take
advantage of our happy
situation, and will defend the
passes into our county, and
neighbourhood, to the last drop
of our blood.
Lord Dunmore's cruel policy
begins at length to be
discovered by the blacks, who
have lately deserted from him
to a considerable number.
When his lordship first went
down to Norfolk he gave great
encouragement to unwary
negroes, but, such was his
baseness, some of them, it is
confidently said, he sent to the
West Indies, where these
unfortunate creatures were
disposed of to defray his
lordship's expences; and others,
such as he took any dislike to,
he delivered up to their
masters, to be punished. Since
the troops under colonel
Woodford's command began
their march, lord Dunmore
issued a proclamation inviting
the of rebels, as he is pleased to
say, to repair to land. A
considerable number at went to
him, but upon their masters
taking the man of allegiance,
they were immediately told
they must return. Some
runaways, however, remained,
but these were kept constantly
employed in digging in wet
ground, till at length the
seventy of their labour forced
many of them to fly. Those that
were left behind have made
several attempts to get off, but
such is the barbarous policy of
this cruel him, he keeps these
unhappy creatures not only
against their will, but intends to
place them in the front of the
battle, to prevent their flying, in
case of an engagement, which,
from their utter ignorance of
fire arms, he knows they will
do.
A correspondent sent us the
following, which, as there is
something remarkable in the
exploit, we have thought proper
to give it a place: ""A few days
ago, Mr. Thomas Archer,
junior, of York, being in
company with some gentlemen
in that place, they discovered a
duck in the river, which was
deemed upwards of 240 yards
from the shore, the
conversation then happened to
be on the excellence of our
rifles, Mr. Archer said he
believed he could kill it with
his riffle, notwithstanding the
greenness of the distance. He
received, and shortly after
brought his gun. He then fired,
and favoured the head of the
duck from its body."" If
beheading would not be doing
too much honour, we could
heartily with that pirate
Dunmore had shared a like fate,
instead of the inoffensive owl.
But alas! such a Negro, such a
daging deserves no other end
than the most ignominious of
culprits, the and the gibbet.
From a correspondent. Twenty
men just returned from off
guard made, application to
colonel Scott for liberty to fire
their wet guns at lord
Dunmore's entrenchment,
which he granted, not thinking
they intended it in reality. They,
however, advanced within 70
yards of the entrenchment, and
began to fire their rifles, which
the enemy returned, with the
loss of one man on our side,
belonging to captain Parker's
company. The fire was kept up
on both sides for two hours; our
men then retreated, and brought
off their dead man with them. It
is supposed that some of the
enemy are killed, as the
riflemen had many fair shoots
at them.
One of Dunmore's tenders
lately went to a place called
Mulberry Island, in Warwick
county, and landed her men,
who went to Mr. Benjamin
Wells's house, with their faces
blacked like negroes, whose
dear companions they are, and
robbed from thence all his
household furniture, four
negroes, a watch, and stock-
buckle. The inhuman wretches
even took the bed on which
several sick infants were
reposing.
Connelly, with Smith and
Campbell, we understand, were
lately taken at Hagar's Town, in
Maryland. These fellows have
long been in confederacy with
Dunmore. Many letters were
found on them from him,
advising them to procure all the
Indians, negroes, and whiles,
they possibly could against
Christmas day, in order to meet
him at Alexandria.
Eleven negroes are now in the
great gaol in this city for
attempting to get to lord
Dunmore. They were
discovered making off in boats,
when our people attacked them,
and wounded two, one it is
thought mortally. They made
very little resistance.
This day doctor William
Pasteur was chosen mayor of
this city for the ensuing year.","Dunmore initially encouraged enslaved individuals to join his side but then reportedly sold some to defray expenses or returned them to their masters for punishment. He kept remaining enslaved people in harsh conditions and used them in combat, despite their lack of training and knowledge; Several enslaved individuals attempted to flee to Dunmore but were caught. Eleven were captured and taken to jail, with some wounded during their capture"

LET no man be dismayed at being proclaimed a Rebel ; let every such person know, that lord Dunmore has no right to declare any man so who has not been legally convicted, and that he himself may be sued and indicted for such proceedings. Whoever consider, well the meaning of the word Rebel will discover that the author of the proclamation is now himself in actual rebellion , having armed our slaves against us, and having excited them to an insurrection ; for which, by the laws of the land, they forfeit their lives. And let it be remembered, that there is a treason against the state , for which such men as lord Dunmore , and even kings , have lost their heads . Let it be remembered, that the king and his governour's are bound by the laws , as much as his subjects; and that no man can be condemned or punished who is not found guilty by a jury of his county, nor legally prosecuted for disobeying the arbitrary mandates of a tyrant . We have taken up arms, it is true; but this we have an undoubted right to do, in defence of the British constitution, of that very constitution which the present royal family was brought in to support, and on the principles of the glorious revolution, those very principles which alone could give our king a right to the throne of England. We are therefore contending not only for our privileges as freemen, but for the support of the British constitution; and if we are supporting that, we are supporting our king, and on the only sure ground on which he can be supported. The present ministry and rebels and traitors to their prince ; they are endeavouring to make him forfeit his crown. The earl of Dunmore, late governour, may be called a genuine rebel . His father was in two rebellions , strictly and properly so called; and he is now himself engaged in one of a more artful and dangerous nature, and he has the effrontery to shift the odious charge on us. If there are loyal subjects in the world, they are in America; they are in Virginia. But enough of this. Independent of these arguments, my countrymen, we may urge, that we have a right to take up arms in self-defence, since we have been threatened with an invasion of savages , and an insurrection of slaves , and have had our negroes and stocks priatically taken from us. The laws of God and nature , and the principles of the constitution , justify it; and, at present, all the feelings of humanity, every suggestion of policy, and the cries of our insulted and imprisoned countrymen, loudly call you TO ARM.",letter regarding how Dunmore supposedly armed slaves against the colonists and excited them to insurrection

By the REPRESENTATIVES of the PEOPLE of the colony and dominion
of VIRGINIA, assembled in GENERAL CONVENTION.

A DECLARATION.

WHAREAS Lord Dunmore, by his proclamation, dated on board the ship William, the 7th day of November 1775, hath presumed, in direct violation of the constitution, and the laws of this country, to declare marital law in force, and to be executed throughout this colony, whereby our lives, our liberty, and property, are arbitrarily subjected to his power and direction; and whereas the said Lord Dunmore, assuming power which the King himself cannot exercise, to intimidate the good people of this colony into a compliance with his arbitrary will, hath declared those who do not immediately repair to his standard, and submit in all things to a government not warranted by the constitution, to be in actual rebellion, and thereby to have incurred the penalties inflicted by the laws for such offences; and hath offered freedom to the servants and slaves of those he is pleased to term rebels , arming them against their masters, and faithful subjects, whose property is rendered insecure, and whose lives are exposed to the dangers of a general insurrection ; We, as guardians of the lives and liberty of the people our constituents; conceive it to be indispensably our duty to protect them against every species of despotism, and to endeavour to remove those fears with which they are so justly alarmed.

If it were possible the understanding of men could be so blinded thatevery gleam of reason might be lost, the hope his Lordship says he hath over entertained of an accommodation between great Britain and this colony might now pass unnoticed; but truth, justice, and common sense, must ever prevail, when facts can be appealed to in their support. It is the peculiar happiness of this colony that his Lordship can be traced as the source of innumerable evils, and one of the principal causes of the misfortunes under which we now labour. A particular details of his conduct since his arrival in this colony can be considered only as a repetition, it having been already fully published to the world by the proceedings of the General Assembly, and a former Convention; but the unremitting violence with which his Lordship endeavours to involve this country in the most dreadful calamities constantly affords new matter for the attention of the public, and will remove every imputation of ingratitude to his Lordship, or of injustice to his character. His Lordship is pleased to ascribe the unworthy part be hath taken against this colony to a necessity arising from the conduct of its inhabitants, whom he hath considered in a rebellious state, but who known nothing of rebellion except the name. Ever zealous in support of tyranny, he hath broken the bonds of society, and trampled justice under his feet. Had his Lordship been desirous of effecting an accommodation of these disputes, he hath had the most ample occasion of exerting both his interest and abilities; but that he never had in view any such salutary end most evidently appears, from the whole tenour of his conduct. The supposed design of the Canada bill having been to draw down upon us a meless and savage energy, the present maneuvers amongst the Italian Catholics in Ireland, and the schemes concerted with D Conlly, and other vile instruments of tyranny, which have appeared by the examination of the said Connelly, justify the supposition, and most fully evince, his Lordship's inimical and cruel disposition towards us, and can best determine whether we have been wrong in preparing to resist, even by arms, that system of tynny adopted by the Ministry and Parliament of Great Britain, of which he is become the rigid executioner in this colony. The many, depredations committed also upon the inhabitants of this colony, by the tenders and other armed vessels, employed by his Lordship for such purposes, the pilfering and plundering the property of the people, and the actual seduction and seizure of their slaves , were truly alarming in their effects, and called aloud and resistance. The persons of many of our peaceable brethren have been seized and dragged to confinement contrary to the principles of liberty, and the constitutions of our country. Yet have born this injurious treatment with unexampled patience, unwilling to tried the blood of our fellow subjects; who, prosecuting the measures of a British Parliament, would sacrifice our lives and property to a relentless fury, and unabating avarice. If a Governor can be authorized, even by Majesty itself, to annual the laws of the land, and introduce the most execrable systems, the law marital; if, by his single fiat he can strip us of our property, can give freedom to our servants and slaves , and arm them for our destruction; let us bid adieu to every thing valuable in life, let us once bend our neck to the galling yoke, and hug the chains prepared for us and our latest posterity!

It is with inexpressible concern we reflect upon the distressed situation of some of our unhappy countrymen who have thought themselves too immediately within the power of Lord Dunmore , and have been induced thereby to remain inactive. We lament the advantages be hath taken of their situation, and at present impute their inactivity, in the cause of freedom and the constitution, not to any defection or want of zeal, but to their defenseless state; and whilst we endeavour to afford them succour, and to support their rights, we expect they will contribute every thing in their power to effect their deliverance. Yet, if any of our people, in violation of their faith plighted to this colony, and the duty they owe to society, shall be found in arms, or continue to give assistance to our enemies, we shall think ourselves justified, by the necessity we are under, in executing upon them the law of retaliation.

Impressed with a just and ardent zeal for the welfare and happiness of our countrymen, we trust they will, on their part, exert themselves in defense of our common cause, and that we shall all acquit ourselves like freemen, being compelled, by the disagreeable, but absolute necessity, of repelling force by force , to maintain our just right and privileges; and we appeal to GOD, who is the sovereign disposer of all events, for the justice of our cause, trusting to his unerring wisdom to direct our councils, and give success to our ARMS.

By the REPRESENTATIVES of the PEOPLE of the colony and dominion of VIRGINIA, assembled in GENERAL CONVENTION.

A DECLARATION

WHEREAS Lord Dunmore, by his proclamation, dated on board the ship William off Norfolk, the 7th day of November 1775, hath offered freedom to such able-bodied slaves as are willing to join him, and take up arms, against the good people of this colony, giving thereby encouragement to a general insurrection , which may induce a necessity of inflicting the severest punishments upon those unhappy people, already deluded by his base and insidious arts; and whereas, by an act of the General Assembly now in force in this colony, it is enacted, that all Negro or other slaves , conspiring to rebel or make insurrection , shall suffer death, and be excluded all benefit of clergy: We think it proper to declare, that all slaves who have been, or shall be seduced, by his Lordship's proclamation, or other arts, to defied their master's service, and take up arms against the inhabitants of this colony, shall be liable to such punishment as shall hereafter be directed by the General Convention. And to the end that all such who have taken this unlawful and wicked step, may return in safety to their duty, and escape the punishment due to their crimes, we hereby promise pardon to them, they surrendering themselves to Col. Williams Woodford, or any other commander of our troops, and not appearing in arms after the publication hereof. And we do further earnestly recommend it to all humane and benevolent persons in this colony to explain and make known this our offer of mercy to those unfortunate people.
