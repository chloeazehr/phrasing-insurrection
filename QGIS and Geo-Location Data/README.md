# Mapping Slave Trade Data and News of Resistance in the 18th Century
---

## Contents
This folder contains the data used to generate animated maps that display both transatlantic and intercolonial slave trade data from the [Slave Voyages](https://www.slavevoyages.org/) website alongside the data I collected on referenced locations in Corpus 1 and Corpus 2.

The data and code for each interactive map can be found in the folders: *South Carolina Combined GeoLoc Data* and *Virginia Combined GeoLoc Data*. 

The other folders contain slave trade data from Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American databases separated rather than combined.

For a deeper discussion of the maps see my *Why Digital History* page on the [repository's website](https://chloeazehr.github.io/phrasing-insurrection/).
