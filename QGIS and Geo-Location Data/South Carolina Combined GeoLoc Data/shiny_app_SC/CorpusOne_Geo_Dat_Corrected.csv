2,The South Carolina Gazette,"July 1, 1732",1732,rebels,Nanny Town,male,"A Letter from a Merchant in Jamaica to his Friend at London, giving an Account of the present State and Condition of that island.
SIR,
IN the last Session of our Assembly, the declining Condition of this Island was taken into Consideration, with Regard to the low Value of its Produce, which daily declining, greatly discourages the present Settlers, and those that have Estates, and hath for some Years past intirely put a Stop to the further Improvement or Settlement of this large, fertile, & valuable Island; so that for seven Years last past, instead of increasing in the Number of our Inhabitants, we have decreased at least one Third, which renders the great Charges we are at for the necessary Support of the Government the more difficult, and almost insupportable to the few remaining Inhabitants. To speak the Truth of our Condition, if some speedy Remedy is not found out, and some new Encouragement given, I expect to see in a few Years this Island left only in the Hands of a few Proprietors of Sugar-Works, who do not amount to above 300, and those we compute one with another employ each 5 white Men, which is but 1500; all our other Inhabitants, and those that have other small Settlements, are going off daily. The Proprietors of Sugar-Works, (many of whom are in Great Britain ) must stand by and keep their Interest in it till the last, as their Estates consist of great Buildings, Plantations, Utensils, large Tracts of Land well cultivated, great Quantities of Cattle, which if they remove their Slaves from, to go to other Countries, will be of no Value but a dead Loss, and so two Thirds of their Estates sunk; this Reason will oblige the Sugar Planters to stand it the longest; and God knows that is a short Space enough, considering the dismal Prospect they have of the declining Condition of their Estates, the Increase of our Rebel Negroes, and the Loss of our Trade. We find all the European Markets, except Great Britain supply'd by the French and Dutch Sugar Colonies, & even a great part of the British Empire likewise, as Ireland , which hath for several Years been supply'd with French Sugar; and the British northern Colonies, which now swarm with People (and are a daily Drain to the Sugar Colonies) supply themselves with Sugar and Molasses from the French and Dutch ; so that all the Consumption of the British Colonies (by the Restriction laid on their Trade) is reduced to Great Britain only; and consequently what Sugars are made more than is required for that Purpose, can be of little other Use than to lower the Price and Value of even that.

These unhappy Circumstances have struck such a Damp on the Inhabitants of this Island, that nothing is heard but Preparations for the Northern Colonies; and Carolina begins to encourage great Numbers to adventure there, forasmuch as by the great, Goodness of his Majesty, and the Wisdom of the Parliament, the Enumeration of Rice is taken off, and they have Liberty to send it to foreign Markets directly, which will bring such a flow of Riches to that Colony as will help, I fear, to be very much the Downfal of the British West India Sugar Colonies, except some such Encouragement be given to them: And it is to be hoped his Majesty's great Goodness will indulge him to recommend the Consideration [ ] to the Wisdom of his Parliament, and that they will have such a Regard to the Welfare of Britain, as to support its principal Members, the Sugar Colonies, which employ such vast Numbers of their Fellow-Subjects in their Mother Country, and are a great support to the Figure they now make in Trade, by the Employment of Ships and Men, this Island alone employing yearly at least 300 sail of Vessels and 5000 Mariners; and considering the advantagious Situation of it in Time of Peace for Trade to New Spain , and in case of a War, all our West India Colonies must be lost without this Island, they having no Harbour or Ports that his Majesty could keep a Squadron in, to command these Seas and protect them; and in case of bad Weather, which always happens amongst them once a Year, these Vessels that would be distressed, must put into an Enemy's Port or perish in the Sea, as we have no other British Settlements to Leeward off St. Christopher's but this Island. These Particulars, and many others too tedious to enumerate, being duly considered, I am sure there is a Necessity of doing something immediately to encourage the present Inhabitants to remain in the Country, and others to come; or I fear, in case of War, it will be so weak as to fall an easy Prey to our Potent Neighbours the French at Hispaniola, who by the great Encouragement from their Mother Country, are within a few Years grown so numerous in their Settlements and Inhabitants, as gives a dismal Prospect to us of this Island.

One Thing I am surprized never was considered among the Means thought of for preventing the Use as well as running French Brandy, which is the lessening the Excise on Rum, the Produce of our own Sugar Colonies, which, were it used instead of French Brandy, would save the Nation as much ready Cash as goes out of it for the Purchase thereof. Rum is the principal Commodity of this Island next to Sugar, and on which the Planters very much depended; it generally sells here from 18d. to 2s. per Gallon, so that 100 Punches of 110 Gallons each here, is about 1000l. this Island Currency, or 200l. Sterling Value; that Quantity, on exportation to Great Britain , is to pay a Duty and Excise to the Crown of about [ ]l. Sterling, without any Drawback on Exportation, besides 6d. per Gallon Freight, [ ] the Loss of Casks, Leakage, &c. so that the Planter at last has a mere Trifle for a Commodity, and what is worse, we have [ ] for Rum at the Northern Colonies, [ ] buy French Molasses so cheap (which without such a Vent would be a Loss to the French ) that they furnish themselves, and export large Quantities to other Countries; so that our Rum that used to contribute greatly to support the contingent Charges of Sugar-Works, by the heavy Duty, Excise, and Loss of the Northern Plantations Trade, will become of little other Value than to be given to Servants & Negroes; whereas, was half the Excise to be taken off, it would greatly increase the Revenue in Great Britain , and be a more effectual Method of preventing the Use of French Brandy than any yet practiced, and would be no Prejudice to English Spirits, not no Ways lessen the Quantity usually made. And sure I am, it highly becomes the Wisdom of the Nation to encourage the Colonies Abroad, each of whose Inhabitants, one with another, gives Bread to three (at least) of their Fellow Subjects in their Mother Country, I may say those of this Island do so treble that Number. Now, could we but obtain the Liberty of exporting our Sugars to Foreign Markets, on paying the Duty it leaves in Great Britain upon Exportation, with other Encouragements, this Island might be rendered the greatest in America , and would become much more Advantagious to Great Britain , in taking off more of its Manufactures, and employing a greater Number of Shipping and Sailors, in Proportion to the Increase of its Produce. For I assure you, that four Fifths of the valuable and improveable Land in this Island is not settled or cultivated, and lies waste as a Receptacle only for our rebellious Runaway Negroes. What I have said is sufficient to shew the infinite Value of this Island, its present miserable Circumstances, and the Necessity of some immediate Relief and Encouragement, to prevent the impending Ruin of the Inhabitants, and the utter Loss of this inestimable Jewel in the British Diadem.",increase of 'rebel negroes' - maroons/runaway slaves,1732-01-01,18.0723,-76.4254,

And every Overseer of a Plantation, which shall not (when in his power) apprehend every strange Negro, or other Slave, which he shall find in his Master's or Mistress's Plantation, without Leave, as foresaid, except as before excepted, and after apprehended shall neglect to punish him, by whipping as aforesaid, shall forfeit Twenty Shillings, the one half to the Poor, to be paid to the Church-wardens of the Parish, where such Forfeiture shall become due, and the other half of him, that will inform for the same, within one Week after such Neglect. Provided always nevertheless, that every Master, Mistress, or Overseer, shall and may have Liberty to whip any strange Negro, or other Slave coming to his or her Plantation, with a Ticket, on Sundays, Fast-days, Holy-days, or any other Times, unless it shall appear to them, that the Business or Errand of the said Slave was to the Master or Mistress of such Plantation, and not to visit, idle, loyter or play with the other Negroes , any thing before mentioned to the contrary thereof notwithstanding. And that no Slave may make farther or other Use of any one Ticket, than was intended by him or her, that granted the same, every Ticket shall be dated, and particularly mention the Name of every Slave employed in the particular Business, and to what place they are sent, and what time they are to return.

And if any person shall presume to give any Negroe or Slave a Ticket in the Name of his Master or Mistress, without his or her Consent, such person so doing shall forfeit the Sum of Forty Shillings, one half to the said Poor, to be disposed of as foresaid, the other half to the person offending, within one Week after the Offence committed. And if he have not sufficient to pay the said Forty Shillings, any Two Justices of the Peace shall have power to inflict any corporal punishment on the Offender, for the willing counterfeiting such Ticket, by ordering such Offender to receive twenty Lashes on the bare back.

It is likewise further Enacted, that [ ] Owner or Head of any Family shall give a Ticket to go to Charles-Town, or from Plantation to Plantation on Sundays, excepting it it be for and about such particular Business, as cannot reasonably be delayed to another Time, under the Forfeiture of Twenty Shillings; and in every Ticket, in that Case given, shall be mentioned the particular business that such Salve is sent about, otherwise such Slave shall be dealt with, as if he had no Ticket.

For the prevention whereof it is Enacted, That no Owner, Master or Mistress of any Family shall suffer, or permit any Slave to go wither, and work where they please, under the penalty of the Forfeiture of Five Shillings Proclamation Money, for every Day he, she, or they shall willingly suffer any Slave to do as foresaid, And every person employing any Slave without a Ticket from the Owner of such Slave, shall forfeit Five Shillings Proclamation Money per Diem to the Informer, for all the Time he shall so employ such Slave . over and besides what he paid, or agreed to pay such Slave for his Work. Provided nevertheless, that the said penalty of Five Shillings per Diem shall not extend to any person, where the property of such Slave is disputable. P rovided also nevertheless, that nothing in this Act shall be construed, or intended to hinder any person from letting their Negroes or Slaves to ire by the Year, or for any lesser time, or by the Day, so as such Negro or Slave is under the Care or Direction of his Master, or some other person by his order entrusted with the Slave, and that the Master is to receive the whole of what the Slave shall earn, and that the person employing such Slave, have a Certificate, Note or Memorandum thereof in writing, from the Owner, Attorney, or Overseer of such Slave.

Pico, who arrived here on Friday last in Twenty one Days from St. Thomas's, we are advis'd, That when he was there (about the latter end of July last) there came in a French Sloop belonging to Martineco, one Myet Master, with Thirty five Men and eight Guns, who had been upon a Trading Voyage on the Coast of Porto Rico, of which the Spaniards having Information, they fitted out a Sloop with about Sixty Men and ten Guns, with strict Orders, if the Frenchmen offered to fire a Gun, to give him on quarters; as soon as the Spaniard came up with the Frenchmen, he fired upon him, which complement was soon answered, which presently drew on broad-side and broad-side, but the Spaniard fired so high that he never touch'd the Frenchmen, whereas he, on the contrary, hull'd the Spaniards several Times, and kill'd and wounded him Eight or Ten Men, upon which finding himself overmatch'd (and being very near the Shoar, and in a Calm) he put some Powder and Shot into a Canoe, with a design to go on Shoar to a small Fort where was mounted Four Guns (whither also was a great Number of Spaniards drawn together to behold the Engagement) and from thence to fire upon him, which the Frenchmen observing he let sly upon the Canoe and put them all a Swiming; after that the Frenchmen boarded the Spanish Sloop and plundered her, and setting her on Fire, disappointed the poor Spaniards of their expected plunder. The French Sloop came into the Harbour of Thomas' s with the Spanish Colours flying under his own, and gave an Account of the Affair as is above related.

Capt. Pico also informs, That after several fruitless attempts to suppress the rebel Negroes at St, John's near that place, (of whose insurrection & murthering the Inhabitants, we formerly mentioned) the Company's Merchant went up to Martineco, to procure some Frenchmen and Indians, who were acquainted with the method of Hunting in the Woods for that purpose, who accordingly came down with two Sloops, each having about one Hundred Men on board, well equip'd for Business upon whose landing; the Negroes engages them, but after they had lost five or six of their Men they fled, and afterwards as the Frenchmen were marching in pursuit of them, they found several of them, to the Number of Forty or Fifty, lying dead, whom they supposed to have kill'd themselves to prevent being taken and tortured as they might expect; but notwithstanding the industrious Searches of the French, about Fifteen of them kept themselves concealed; who, upon the Sloops going away, returned to their Masters Plantations, and to their usual Labour, upon which their Masters agreed to seize them at a certain Hour (left there should be a discovery, and so some of them escape,) which accordingly they did, and sent them to the Fort at St. Thomas's, where they soon had their Tryal, and were condemned to die in several Forms of Torture, (according to the Custom of those Governments,) which was to put in Execution the very Day he left the Island; but two of them to prevent it had put an End to their Lives the night before the intended Execution. It is observable, that one of the Rebels was so hardy, that he would not go in with the rest, but was resolved to kill some body before he was taken, upon which a Company went out and shot him, so an End was put to the melancholy Scene, thad had occasioned so much Trouble and Expence to the poor Planters there.

into the Affair of the late
Conspiracy of the Slaves
there, dated December
30, 1736 Whereby it
appears that after the
Execution of 12 of the
chief Conspirators,
frequent Saturday
Night's Meetings of
great numbers of
Conspirators had been
for a great while held at
several Places and that
by drinking a Health in
Rum or some other
Liquor mixt with Grave
Dirt and some time
Cocks-blood infused an
Oath of Secrecy and
Fidelity had been taken
by many hundred
Slaves, whereof the
Words were various, but
the Tenor was to stand
by and be true to each
other, and to kill the
Whites, Man, Woman
and Child, to assist in
the Execution of this,
when called upon by the
Chiefs, and to suffer
Death rather than
discover That 37 more
were since convicted,
condemned and
executed, 42 proposed to
be banished, and two
were fled from Justice,
and rewards publickly
put upon their Heads, to
take them alive or kill
them in pursuit.
The 13th Paragraph of the said
Report is in the Words
following
As it seems to us agreeable to
the Intent of the last Order of
your Excellency and Council,
that we should report what our
Opinion is as to the Safety of
the Island; we think it will not
be impertinent to touch as
introductory to it, upon what
we think encouraged our Slaves
to attempt our Ruin and
Destruction, and tho' we cannot
be very certain by what
particular Inducement the
Slaves might be brought to set
on foot this inhuman Plot; yet
we may say with some
Certainty that next to hopes of
Freedom, the greatest was the
inequality of Numbers of white
and black Neither can we lay
down Rules to remedy this
Evil, but think it would be
greatly helped, if Gentlemen
resided on their own Estate
here, and that Men of the best
Figures and Fortune would not
so generally put Slights upon
the Commissions of the Peace
and Militia: and that Slaves
were disabled form being
Handicraft Tradesmen,
Overseers, Drivers or Distillers,
Shop-keepers or Hawkers and
Pedlars or Sailors, nor suffered
to keep Horses, nor to work our
for themselves, and that more
of our menial Servants, and our
wet and dry Nurses were to be
Whites and no Fidlers for gain
but Whites to be suffered, and
that generally more
Encouragement should be
given to Whites by our Laws
and Practice, and less to Slaves,
and our present wholesome
Laws, for governing of our
Slaves vigourously executed
______How far we may be in
danger still from this last
Conspiracy, we cannot
determine, since undoubtedly
there are Hundreds by us
undiscovered, who have bound
themselves by impious Oaths to
destroy us, Man, Woman and
Child: from hence it may be
concluded, what must be the
Spirit and Inclinations of the
Slaves, and how weak and vain
it would be in us to say the
Country is in Safety, or to
advice your Excellency to put a
Stop to any further Inquiry.
The Conclusion is as follows.
We cannot look upon this our
Report as complete, or offer as
much, till we have done Justice
to our Brother Robert
Arbuthnot Esq; whose Modesty
will not, we find, suffer him to
subscribe to Truths, which
happen to be so advantageous
to his Character and so
meritorious as they must be
thought in the Eyes of this
Country. At a Time when we
were in a profound Lethargy as
to any Apprehensions of
Danger from our Slaves, this
Gentleman took the Alarm at
Circumstances which pass'd
unobserved by us all, tho' 'tis
now plain they are too weighty
to be neglected. The Disparity
of the Numbers between the
white Inhabitants of this Island
and the Slaves he observed
long since, and mentioned it as
too great to be balanced or
rendered unhurtful by any thing
but the Strictest Discipline over
them, or which he saw so little;
on the Contrary so much
Licenciousness amongst them
as to receive great Uneasiness
from it: And indeed as a
Magistrate for the Town of St.
John, had always discouraged
and severely punished
Delinquents whenever
complained of. His well
grounded Apprehensions mov'd
him to give strict Orders to
Constables and other Peace
Officers to look narrowly into
the Behaviour of the Negroes,
and upon the Encouragement
and Invitation which he gave
for Intelligence he was soon
furnished with sufficient
Grounds to found upon it those
Information, which being laid
before your Excellency
enduced such Measures, as
hitherto secured our Lives and
Properties We submit therefore
whether, under God, the
Preservation of all that is dear
to us be not in a great Measure
owing to the Perspicacity and
Discretion of this Gentleman.

in Antigua, which was

before it was put in

We have since the following
particulars from a Gentleman in
that Island, by a Letter dated
Dec. 13. Viz.
That after the above
Executions, the General and
Inhabitants thinking all Safe,
dismissed the Troops; but as
Providence would have it, that
Night, a Negro who had been
Evidence against the former,
seeing his Master (Maj.
Nuegent) come home, went to
him and told him, Bockorau go
to sleep too soon; when being
ask'd the Reason, showed this
significant Action, He plucked
a single Haircut of his Head,
and said, you do no more than
so; but could not accuse
Particulars. This occasioned the
taking up two or three
suspected, who said, there was
a much deeper Plot, but they
were not thoroughly in the
secret, and if they would come
to the Bottom, they must be yet
more severe: Which piece of
Negro Advice was taken, and
four Persons proved to be in the
first Plot, hung up in Chains
alive, some of which Died in
about 50 Hours, only one
(which was Coll. Morgan's
Ned) survived 8 Days and
Nights: This terrible the others
in Custody, who were kept
apart, so that they made the
following Confession, viz. That
Court (who was a Cormantce)
had begun the Design, and had
had Entertainments in several
Places, on the Island, to draw in
the Negroes that were the Top-
Tradesmen and Born in the
Island (commonly called
Creoles) to his Plot, which they
fell into; but with a different
View to what he apprehended:
For they swore to serve him in
Massacreeing all the white
People, and making him King;
But then among themselves,
carried on a secret Plot, which
was, that as soon as they had
accomplished that, to Murder
him and all the rest of the
Cormantees, and set up a King
of their own; so that Court, his
Generals and Prime Minister
being Executed, affected them
no more than the Loss of so
many Hands; they still went on
with their Design, intending to
execute it on the Christmas
Holidays, when by Law they
are to have three Days allowed
them.
As most of these were the
favorite Negroes, brought up in
the Families, which laid this
Scheme, so they could carry it
on with greater secrecy, many
of the Heads being capable of
Writing and Reading, and had
been taught the Christian
Religion conformable to the
frequent Admonition of our
worthy Diocesan the Bishop of
London, and therefore in
Swearing the Multitude into
their Scheme, they swore them
and administered the Sacrament
to all such as professed
themselves Christians
according to the Rites of the
Bishop's Church, the others
they swore according to their
several Country Forms; which
gives us a Specimen of what
may be expected from
Converting Negroes. Mr.
Martin's Tony and Coll.

Mason) took upon them this
Office: Tony was broke on the
Wheel, Ned Gibbetted alive as
above.
In all 36 have suffered. Our
Goal and Guard-House are still
full, and about 20 on board a
Ship Our Magistrates hardly
know what to do further. Such
Executions are shocking! We

MY long and tedious Indisposition has prevented furnishing you in Time with particular Remarks on a Letter from Antigua, dated December 13, which you have inserted in your Gazette No. 169. which gives a deplorable Account of the miserable Circumstances that Island labours under from their African & Creolian Tribe. I heartily symphatize with them, and wish it in my Power to extricate them for their Distress. Yet I am satisfied a Method may be found to their Advantage, superiour to what is practized with Them, or among Us, that will effectually answer Their and Our End, (if a superiour Power don't interpose,) and prevent what Patrolls and other Guards (tho' necessary in their Place) cannot.

I'm sorry to find the Author of that Letter so angry with, and incens'd against the Christian ad holesome Admonitions of their ghostly Father the Bishop of London; who only admonished and advised them to instruct those poor miserable Creatures whose Unhappiness it is to be under the heavy Yoke of Task-Masters, in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, that thereby they may be qualified to discharge their Duty aright, both towards God and Man. This I think every one that is conversant with the Scripture, and acquainted with the Principles of Our most holy Religion, will concur with me, in saying, that it is no more than the Reasonable Service of all those that are possess'd of them. I'm sure they are intelligible beings, and have Souls to save or lose as well as we: Therefore demand that some Care may be taken of their Souls, whilst they are in Bondage, that so, when they come to be set at Liberty by the grim Serjeant of the Grave, they may have a Place of Rest assign'd them, where Barbarity and Cruelty will have no Admittance.

Strange! very strange it is, that to instruct those poor Creatures in the Knowledge of Life and Salvation in and through a Mediator, should involve and plunge us into those manifold Dangers, that threaten our Destruction. Can we suppose that God ever design'd Religion for such an End? God forbid! Yet our Author, (if I take him right) would fain persuade us to believe, that to instruct them in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, is the only way to destroy ourselves.

Our Author, after he hath been giving us an Account of the Circumstances of their Island, and their Conformity to the Bishop's Admonition, concludes: "" which gives ""us a Specimen of what may be expected ""from converting Negroes. "" As if he had said, 'Tis true, we have often been admonished by our worthy Diocesan, of our Duty, and in Obedience to him, have instructed our Slaves in the Knowledge of the Christian Religion; but what is the consequence of this? Why, Insurrection , Murder and Blood, and what not besides! This is what may be expected from converting Negroes ! 'Tis surprizing, that a Christian, or nay on that bears the Name, should load it with such Infamy.

Dear SIR,

I Was last Night shock'd with the melancholy News of the South East Part of Charles Town being burnt down on Tuesday How deplorable is the Condition of many there, that are in a few Hours reduc'd to want of Bread! Surely God's just Judgments are upon us __ Is there Evil befallen to a City, and the Lord hath not done it? faith the Prophet. We have been harden'd under the Sun-shine, the bounteous Dispensations of his Providence; and tho' for some Year's past, he hath at divers Times been scourging of us, by Drought; by repeated Diseases on Man and Beast; by Insurrections of our Slaves , and lately by Bassling shamefully our Enterprize against our Enemy, so as to make us a By-Word and an Hissing among the Heathen that are round about us; yet we have not laid it to Heart to turn to HIM As are the People, so are the Priests: Every one seeking after Gain; nourishing their Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter; and few, very few, say within themselves, wherefore hath the Lord done these Things? Or turn to seek unto the Hand that hath smitten us. O! that this fiery Dispensation may now lead us to Repentance, and truly humble us before GOD, that the Fury of his Anger may turn away from us, and that we be not utterly consumed! How ought we every one to mourn and lament over our Iniquities, and the Iniquities of our Province and Nation; and lift up our Hearts with our Hands to God in the Heavens, with continual Intercessions for ourselves and People, that he may give us true Faith and Repentance; forgive all our Iniquities, and incline our Hearts to be intirely devoted to keep his Laws, and to glorify his Holy Name; that He may incline, rule and direct the Hearts of our King and all in Authority, so that they may faithfully and duly execute Justice, and maintain true Religion and Godliness; and that He may inspire all Ministers of his holy Word and Ordinances with heavenly Wisdom and Grace, that they may understand his Will and faithfully teach, exhort and reprove, both by Example and Precept, in much Love and Lowliness of Mind. O how great will their Judgment be who do the Work of the Lord negligently, and speak leasingly, and cry Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace, deceiving precious Souls and causing them to sleep in their Sins to Damnation. Many, too many such are crept into Christ's visible Church, for whom we may justly take up Jermiah's Lamentation, and say, The Prophets have seen vain and foolish Things for thee, and they have not discover'd unto thee thine Iniquity, Lam ii 14. Many indeed in our Day have seen vain and follish Things; their Hearts have run after their Covetousness, and they have delighted themselves in the foolish and and vain Enjoyment of worldly Goods and Pleasures, nourishing and indulging themselves in the same Passions, Tempers and Delights with other Worldly minded Men, and by their Practices have made the Commandments and Doctrines of the blessed JESUS (their pretended Master) as much as in them lay of none Effect; for they entice the People to follow their Example, and depart from God: Thus do they pretendedly take upon them a Commission from the Lord of Hosts to fight the Devil's Battles, and, Judas- like, betray our Lord and Master with pretended Kisses of Friendship. ____ O! how sore will the Punishment of such negligent Watchmen be! Ezek. Xxxiii. 6 But if the Watchman see the Sword come, and blow not the Trumpet, and the People be not warned; if the Sword come and take any Person from among them, he is taken away in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at the Watchman's Hand, faith the LORD Who there sheweth EZEKIEL his Duty from the 7th Verse, saying, So thou, O Son of Man, I have set thee a Watchman unto the House of Israel: Therefore thou shalt hear the Word at my Mouth and warn them from me. __ When I say unto the Wicked, O wicked Man, thou shalf surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the Wicked from his Way, that wicked Man shall die in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at thine Hand.___ See JER. xxiii I EZEK. Xxxiv 2d to the 10th We be to the Shepherds or Pastors that scatter the Sheep; that feed themselves, and do not feed the Sheep And JER. xxiii 21. I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran, faith the LORD; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. And again, Verse 30. I am against the Prophets that steal my Word every man from his Neighbour, faith the LORD: These all serve for Gain They are Thieves and Robbers who come not in by the Door of the Sheep sold, but climb up the Wall by carnal Helps, and get in, to prey on the Sheep; neither follow the Foot-steps of our true Shepherd, but covet the Fleece only How many poor careless Souls have we in every Parish that stand in Need of being informed of their Danger, and of the absolute Necessity of being born again of GOD, and having CHRIST's personal Righteousness imputed to them, before they can have any well-grounded Hope of being finally saved! How many within a few Miles of their Teachers die in their Sins, without being warned or exhorted to come to CHRIST by Faith! The Blood of such will be required at their Teacher's Hands. O! how becoming the Office of Ambassadors of JESUS CHRIST would it be, to go forth to every Soul (of their Parishioners at least) and make Offers of Peace, and invite them to come in on Gospel Terms? Can any love love their Master with all their Souls and Strength? Can they love the Flock as he loved it, and not seek diligently the Wellfare of every Sheep committed to their Charge? Are immortal Souls of less Value now than in the Days of our Saviour and his Apostles, that the same Concern shou'd not now be shewn for their eternal Wellfare as was then? Can they deal faithfully with their master, and not stand in the Gap to deliver unwary Souls from the Jaws of the Lion? This is just as consistent with their high Calling, as for any one to stand by and see a Man deliberately murder himself, and not persuade him from his Rashness.

Shall our Clergy at this Day shew a furious Zeal about the Decrees and Cannons of the Church, even so as to persecute Christ's faithful Ministers for not conforming exactly to these Appendages of Religion (tho' they themselves break these Cannons every Day) and have no Bowels of Love, no Pity for poor perishing Souls, that are wandring in worse than AEgyptain Darkness? Is not this to tythe Mint and Cummin, and neglect Mercy and Judgment? OShame! Shame! Is this to imitate their Master, who went about doing Good? Is this like St. Paul's Practice, who not only taught publickly, but from House to House? Surely the God of this World hath blinded the Eyes of such false Prophets O how will their Mammon of Unrighteousness eat them as doth Fire, at the glorious Appearance of our Lord, when he shall call them to an Account! I doubt not but the Devil triumphs in beholding these Shepherds at the Head of their Flocks, following him down to the Regions of Darkness for Mammon Be astonish'd, O Heavens! Mourn, O Earth! because the Deceiver is come forth amongst us with great Power, seducing both Pastors and People, to deal falsly with the great GOD of Heaven and Earth; to despise his Mercies, his Chastisements, his Authority, and even the Son of his Love, whom they they by wicked Hands crucify daily, for the Wages of Unrighteousness. The LORD hath sworn by the Excellency of Jacob, surely I will never forget any of their Works, Amos viii. 7. And will he not deal with the Inhabitants of this Province as with the Obstinate of Judah, who like unto us despised Mercies and Chastisements. See Jer xxiv. 9. 10. And I will deliver them to be removed, & c. for their Hurt, to be a Reproach and a Proverb, a Taunt and a Curse in all Places whether I shall drive them. I will send the Sword, the Famine, and the Pestilence among them, 'till they be consumed from off the Land that I gave unto them and to their Fathers. Shall not our Land mourn for this, and every one that dwelleth therein? Jer. iv. 28. O! that they wou'd Hear and give Ear, and not be proud, for the LORD hath spoken. Jer. xiii. 15. His Drought hath spoken; His Diseases inflicted on us and our Cattle have spoken; the Insurrections of our Slaves have spoken; our Augustine Expedition hath spoken; the Faithful of CHRIST's Ministers have lately, in a remarkable Manner, been speaking; and the yet later dreadful Fire of Charles-Town hath spoken Terror: And if we regard not this to lay it to Heart, humble ourselves, and repent truly of our Sins; the just GOD will yet pour out upon us more terrible Vials of his Wrath. If only at a Hand Writing of God on the Wall, which the great Belshazzer understood not, his Countenance was changed, his Thoughts troubled, the Joints of his Loins loosed. and his Knees [ ] one against another thro' Fear; shou'd we not much more tremble, whose Crimes are against the clear Light of eternal Truth, and not only see but feel GOD's Hand upon us. - - O! that our KING wou'd humble himself, lest his Principalities shou'd come down, even the Crown of his Glory; for GOD regardeth nt Princes, except their Thrones are established in Righteousness. O! that all in Authority under him, in the Civil Powers amongst us throughout his Dominions, would humble themselves, and duly consider, that the great GOD, by whom they enjoy any Power, will strictly require at their Hands a due and conscientious Improvement of the Talents committed to their Trust. And O! that all who stile themselves Ambassadors of Jesus Christ, wou'd humble themselves; and consider well their Mission, who sent them, and the Importance of the Errand on which they are sent. And O! that our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who opened our Eyes of the Blind and raised to the Dead to Life, would be graciously pleased to pen all our Eyes, to see and know clearly, his eternal Truths declared to us in his holy Scriptures, which only are able to make us wise unto Salvation! May He raise and quicken our filthy, sinful, sluggish Hearts, from their Lethargy of sensual Delights, to seek that Pearl of great Price his everlasting Righteousness, and a Union of Spirits with Himself, which only is able to give us true Joy, the full Assurance of his Favour here, and of eternal Blessedness when Time shall be no more.","Charles Town (Charleston) fire in South East part of the city; compares god's punishments of disease and drought to ""insurrections of our slaves""",1741-01-01,32.78096,-79.93554,

Assembly of the Island of JAMAICA.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Council and Assembly of your Majesty's Island of Jamaica ; crave Leave to approach your Royal Throne, being convinced we should be wanting in that Duty we owe your Majesty, and the Trust reposed in us, if we did not take the earliest Occasion of laying before your Majesty those Burthens which disturb the happiness of your People, and threaten Ruin and Destruction to a Colony of such Importance to your Majesty's Government.

The Expence in supporting that just and necessary War, which your Majesty engaged in for vindicating the Trade of your Subjects, and supporting the Liberty and Independancy of Europe, called upon us to bear a Part of that Burthen, which we did with a Warmth and Chearfulness disproportioned to our Abilities, and as we apprehend in a much greater Degree than the rest of your Subjects.

These were our Efforts whilst we were labouring under an Additional Duty on Molasses-Spirits, which, though unavoidable from the Exigency of the Times, does in a most grievous Manner affect the Inhabitants in general, but more particularly the poorer Sort, and prevents the Cultivations of the unsettled Lands, it being evident that Sugar produced from new Lands, abounds with a greater Proportion of Syrup, than that raised from old Plantations.

And whilst we were under the pressure of that Duty, we had the Mortification to find ourselves subjected to a further Tax of One Shilling and Six-pence per Hundred imposed the last Session of Parliament upon all sugar produced from your Majesty's Colonies, which we fear, if continued, must in the End transfer that valuable Commodity to our great Rivals in Trade, the natural Enemies of your Majesty's Crown and Government.

Permit us further, most Gracious Sovereign, to represent our just apprehension of a further Distress arising from the Interruption of a free Navigation in these Seas, being informed that the Spaniards, our dangerous and jealous Neighbours, have detained, and searched on the high Seas, a Vessel belonging to your Majesty's Subjects, bound to this Island, as may appear by two Affidavits, which we humbly beg leave to lay before your Majesty.

These, Royal Sir, are Melancholly Truths, and the true Causes of our Distress. From these Causes arise our want of Money, and Credit, both at home and abroad. From thence the scarcity of Inhabitants in a Country so extensive and so happily situated for Trade may easily be accounted for, notwithstanding the great Encouragement given by our Laws every white Person shall become a Settler.

From these a further Desertion of our Island is to be justly apprehended, and under such Circumstances, we cannot think of any other Means of Security, then an immediate Protection from your majesty's great Care and Tenderness of your Subjects.

These Considerations oblige us to renew our Applications to your Majesty for another Regiment of Soldiers to guard and defend us: Daily apprehensive of an Insurrection of our Negroes , and thereby in Danger of loosing whatever in our distress'd Condition remains valuable.

We therefore do most humbly beseech your Majesty to take into your Royal Consideration this our humble Address and Representation, and that you will be pleased to grant us such Relief as is [ ] to your Majesty's great Goodness and Wisdom.",Jamaica fear of slave revolt; request for royal support,1749-01-01,17.98333,-76.95,

I WAS in company the other day with some gentlemen from town, when the discourse turned on the negro bill now on the carpet.—I was not surprised at the objections that were made, because the planter and merchant think themselves equally concerned to prevent its going down. Men will always make use of a thousand frivolous excuses, to avoid taking the best measures for securing their property; because the majority will always embrace a present gain, to their future and permanent interest. The legislature will think differently from them: they know, there is hardly a society of men, who do not think the whole prosperity of a nation depends upon their single fate; so that should they at any time be consulted, their answers will be mysterious, partial, and inclining with a strong bias to their own emolument. I am no so old, or so weak, as to suffer myself to be surrounded with fears and suspicions, or startled at distant dangers, yet I think our situation alarming: Heaven knows our military capacity is not very great: and our numbers are so inconsiderable that should a general defection happen, we might easily be served, as Gulliver did geese and turkies when he lived among the Lilliputians. Whenever a Law is to be passed, I taken it but one consideration is to be made, ""whether it will be for the interest of the whole."" Individuals must be thrown aside: for, in applying remedies to the evils of government, some private men must suffer; they who introduce those evils will, and it is intended they should. It is said, that an increase of inhabitants is an addition of strength and riches. Among a free people it is undoubtedly true: but where Slavery is allowed, exceptions are to be made. An increase of negroes adds to the riches of a country, only where they are so employed as to bring in a reasonable profit to the master; otherwise they become a burden: they never can add to the strength of a people, but subject it to perpetual dangers, which will always be greater, according to the disproportion. Now the difference of the number of whites and blacks, and the present situation of our planters, sufficiently evinces, we labour under both these difficulties. The arguments which, as the company informed me, were made use of, against the bill. turn upon the inconveniences that will arise to particulars: many of them are so nearly alike, that in my answer to them, you must not be surprised, if I sometimes am guilty of repetitions, and make use of reasons that carry the same appearance. I could have been less prolix, and much shorter in my remarks: but, as I have the thing at heart, I chose to imitate them in this disuse way; because I know when men are almost determined upon a point, they must have the inconveniences often repeated, in order to deter them from that determination.

1. It will tend towards decreasing our white inhabitants.

The great disproportion between whites and blacks daily increasing when an unlimited importation of negroes is allowed. I am a little surprised that this objection should be started in case a temporary prohibition should take place. It is a misfortune for the province, the people are too much disposed to do every thing by negroes which can be done by them. Private avarice makes us blind to the true interest of our country. Each individual will have tradesmen among his slaves , to the great discouragement of whites of an inferior order, whom of all other men we stand most in need of. Now, if the number of negroes were lessened; if they were not suffered to increase; necessity at length would oblige us to take them for the cultivation of our lands, necessity would oblige us to call in more tradesmen of all kinds; nor would there be any difficulty in inticing them over: there are as many indigent and unemployed hands in England as ever; but the spirit and activity which was once seen among them is loft, because the alluring prospect of an easily livelihood is now no more. No man will deny, that the security and wealth of a nation consists in the number of its middling men of a free condition , and a gradual and imperceptible transition from the highest to the lowest. If this pernicious disposition of importing such quantities of slaves ; if this sordid method of bringing them up to trade of all kinds continues, this gradation will be impossible: in a little time, our province will consist chiefly of a few planters and merchants, subject to the insurrections of salves, because numerous and disaffected.

II. That the possibility of the planter's extricating himself from the debt contracted for negroes, in one or two lucky crops, is a sufficient inducement for purchase frog a greater number.

It is an observation which seldom falls under the eye of the people, but which it is supposed every legislative power is acquainted with, ""that the ignorance, the negligence, the prodigality and unavoidable misfortunes which surround mankind, must always subject the greater part of them to distressing circumstances."" For these reasons, civil societies form laws to lessen those evils which they cannot eradicate. Now, if a spirit of planting, like an epidemical disease, spreads itself all around; surely the wisdom of our senators would deserve the highest applause, should they endeavour to put a stop to it. the mechanic, the little tradesman, sets out with a view of getting a livelihood by his labour; if that is comfortable, he is satisfied: But the merchant, the planter, they have a more extensive prospect, they intend amassing a fortune : The bait is more alluring; their conduct is to be the more narrowly watched. Unless a planter can set out upon his own bottom, the amazing height of interest is such, that he must make sixteen per cent of his money in order to clear eight; and this is what the most sanguine of them cannot expect, tho' thoroughly acquainted with their business. the success of a few plantations can be no objection to what I have advanced, as I talk of the whole body. And when men launch out beyond their fortunes , in affairs that depend upon chance and accidents, as the planter does; they enter upon what is destructive to society, and ought not to be allowed in a well regulated state: the greater part of them must sail, their fall will not be alone, many will be involved with him; for as he finds his fortune decrease, like the spirited gambler upon the brink of destruction, he will venture any sum, if you permit him, upon the single throw of a die, because there is a distant prospect of succeeding; but no wise man will approve of his conduct.

III. That it will be driving our young people out of the country, to places where negroes and lands are cheaper.

The intention of a negro act is, to prevent a growing inconvenience. It is shrewdly suspected the planters have gone more than one step too far, and an attempt is about to be made to prevent others from falling into the same mistake. Human affairs are so complicated, that I believe some ill consequences attend almost every salutary measure of government: and should a few young men of over-heated imaginations, and wild notions of aggrandizing their fortunes elsewhere, be induced to leave the province because such a act does take place; yet a fear of this kind ought not to work upon the mind of any man: his folly would be equal to those, who would prevent an importation of wine, because a few rakes would get drunk with it. Besides. I do not see that this self-transportation of our youth would be the consequence: young fellows of fortune will still find it worth their while to enter into the planting business. But, says the objector, this is suffering a few individuals to monopolize the landed interest. Ne factor ulira crepodam is a maxim. If a considerable sum of money is requisite for any employment, in a country where interest is high, men of small fortunes ought not to think of entering into it. In whatever station of life fortunes have been made, mens eyes have been dazzled with the prospect; they will venture beyond what reason dictates: but it becomes the public to check their impetuosity, and to prevent industry from loading itself beyond what it can bear.

Now when young men of small fortunes see so many difficulties attending the cultivation of lands; when they see the high interest on one side, and the high price of negroes on the other, I do not imagine it follows, that they will leave the province. This is supposing the spirit of planting is an incurable disease, and therefore not to be attempted. Such a support on would be pernicious to the greatest degree. I am rather apt to think, those of a sufficient fortune would enter into the different branches of trade; those who have less, will undoubtedly apply themselves to the lower employments, which we should always endeavour to encourage. Men who live at home in any tolerable degree of affluence, will never leave their friends and families where they are fixed and settled, to go in search of an interest that at best is precarious. The poorer fort, surely will remain where they are, because a pretty large fun being required to set them up as planters it is morally impossible they can borrow that sum in a country where they are strangers. Georgia, it is said, can only rival us in planting; and it is a fact, the rice lands in Georgia are nearly adequate to ours in price; and the price of negroes will always rise, in proportion to that of the land: there then the same inconveniences will attend them.

IV That it will be robbing the province of a considerable duty towards paying of taxes.

I take this objection to be exceeding trifling. In laying duties upon any thing imported into a country, the only consideration that ought to be made is. ""Whether it will be for the advantage of the community."" If it is found that it will, the duty is to be as light as possible; if not, a total prohibition, or an addition that will amount to the same thing, ought to take place. But I cannot see how the public can suffer; for in a country like ours, where the higher rank of men are brought up to no employments, but trade, planting, and the law, no duty will prevent them from purchasing; and the additional sum that is laid upon them, will make amends for the smaller number that will be sold.

V. That it will throw the rubes of the country into the bands of a few, and promote usury.

How an act which is to prevent men from running in debt, and to enable them the sooner to discharge that debt, can promote usury, I cannot conceive. I can easily foresee, if negroes are to be brought into the country upon the tooting they now are, an usury (if I may so call it) of the most dangerous consequence would ensue. It is the interest of the planter to steer clear from the clutches of the merchant: if he once involves himself there, he is hampered: he can no longer demand an equal consideration for his rice, but must be reduced to the necessity of taking whatever the merchant offers, in order to discharge the debt he owes him: if he refuses, his ruin in inevitable; his negroes and plantation are sized; his scheme of making his fortune is overturned; and that bubble, which he has taken so much pains to blow up, will now be broke. This is far from being a chimera: the principles of trade are not very generous. We know that all bodies of men act upon interested movies; and the welfare of the little society to which they belong taken entire possession of their thoughts. A combination so backed by interest, is to be feared with the greatest reason. Experience tells us, it was so in this very province not long ago: and the planter, after labouring for some time under these very disadvantages, with the greatest good fortune, emerged from the difficulties that were likely to overwhelm him.

VI. That it cannot be said the planter runs in debt, as the negro is an equivalent.

At the time of the purchase no doubt he is; but unless the profits of planting exceed the interest of money, his fortune must decline: the incertainty of life, diseases, the hardship of labour, and the gradual decay of nature, perpetually lessens the principal (for so I call slaves ) of the planters: and were it not clear, their debts were increasing to a prodigious degree, an attempt for a law of this kind would never have been undertaken, however salutary it might be, not only for the interest by the safety of the province.

VII. That it will be the making of Georgia, to our destruction.

If that province was subject to a foreign power; if they could get the materials fro the cultivation of lands cheaper; if the interest of money was lower than with us; if their industry was greater; then we might entertain apprehensions of danger: but when we reflect the same ships which we have, must supply them; when we reflect they must have recourse to the same markets, for things they stand in need of, and at the same price; when we consider they are less capable of giving that price, because they have less money; when we consider, the negro merchant cannot afford to sell Irish negroes for less than he does to us and unless we make this supposition, we must acknowledge ourselves to be vilely imposed upon) these notions are vain, and not to be regarded. The time which is allotted for the continuance of the act is so short, they can make no progress before we shall be upon the footing we now are; and this I think will prevent any man in his senses from deserting his country; and projectors and madmen we ought to be glad to get rid of.

VIII. That it is ingratitude to our mother-country.

There are a sufficient number of markets in America, equally good, to take off all the salves exported from Africa. wherever they are sold, they must be supported and maintained. Neither ther negro merchant, the shipping, or the manufactures of Great-Britain, would suffer from a total prohibition; from a temporary one of two or three years: it is unworthy their notice: But the good of one of his majesty's most flourishing provinces, is to be regarded before the trifling advantage of a private set of men; for, if we compare their profits in this place, to what will redound to Great-Britain from the affluence of the province itself, it will be trifling. We are so restrained by the act of navigation, and other subsequent acts of parliament, that it is impossible we should thrive, without our mother-country finding it turn to her account. They who make use of this argument, must be interested in the negro trade: If they will have a regard for our common parent, let them encourage an increase of whites; for it is indisputably true, that one white-man will take off more of English manufacture than four negroes. These gentlemen seem to justly an observation of my lord Bacon's, ""that there are a race of men in the world, who would willingly and readily set fire to their neighbour's house, for the insignificant advantage of roasting their own eggs at it.""",fear of enslaved insurrection or being subject to it due to disproportion of demographics in the colony; does not explicitly describe enslaved resistance,1761-01-01,33.8361,-81.1637,

By Captain Brasher from Port au Prince we have confirmed accounts of great disturbances on the island of Hispaniola, on which occasion many of the planters there have been taken up and hanged without judge or jury.— The real ground of the quarrel seems not to be well known, but it is said to be occasioned by the General Prince de Rohan's orders for every inhabitant to be trained up to the use of arms, and to be mustered once a month; which the planters refuting to obey, military executions ensued, from whence spring insurrections that have ended in the death of many of the inhabitants.— It is generally thought to have some other foundation than this; for it is a known proverb, that when a dog is to be beat, it is easy finding a stick.— Beetled effects of an arbitrary government.
